A processional with Lewis's casket was carried Sunday across the bridge where he and other civil rights marchers were beaten 55 years ago on Bloody Sunday, a key event in the fight for voting rights for African Americans. Lewis will lie in repose at the Alabama capitol on Sunday afternoon.

A crowd began gathering near the bridge before the crossing as state troopers and police officers stood along the barricaded sidewalks nearby.

A series of events began Saturday in Lewis's hometown of Troy, Ala., to pay tribute to the late Democratic congressman and his legacy. He will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol next week before his private funeral Thursday at Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once led.

A native of Pike County, Ala., Lewis became involved in the civil rights movement as a young man.

In 1965, he and other marchers were beaten in Selma. The news coverage of the event helped galvanize support for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Frank and Ellen Hill drove more that four hours from Monroe, La., to watch the procession.

Frank Hill, 60, said he remembers, as an African American child, watching news footage of Lewis and other civil rights marchers being beaten by law enforcement officers.

""I had to come back and see John Lewis cross the bridge for the last time,"" said Hill. ""It's funny to see the state troopers here to honour and respect him rather than beat the crap out of him,"" Hill said.

The team's head coach, Andy Reid, told a news conference Saturday that he was proud of the Quebec-born Super Bowl champion.

""I'm a huge Larry Duvernay-Tardif fan. I also was raised by a doctor, so I understand the dedication that it takes to be a doctor. We're all blessed to have doctors in our lives,"" Reid said.

The 29-year-old from Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Que., has a medical degree from McGill University, and began working at a long-term care facility in Quebec as an patient attendant in April, less than three months after winning the Super Bowl.

At the time, Quebec's long-term care facilities, known as CHSLDs, were critically understaffed as the coronavirus had spread rapidly throughout the network.

The provincial government was pleading with Quebecers from all walks of life to volunteer in the facilities in order to provide basic care to the residents, many of whom were going long periods without food or water.

Nearly 4,000 people have died in Quebec's CHSLDs because of the virus, and thousands of health-care workers have been infected.

Duvernay-Tardif' has support of teammates too

Reid said the rest of the team also supports Duvernay-Tardif's decision to continue working as a patient attendant.

""The veteran players support him, and the coaches support him. We know ... when the football is over, this is going to be one of the best doctors ever,"" Reid said.

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes said though he was surprised by the decision, he understands why his teammate made the choice he did.

""I know it was difficult for him, but you respect the decision, for him to kind of put his thoughts aside and kind of do what he thought was best to help out his community and the world as he sees it,"" Mahomes said in a press conference Saturday.

Duvernay-Tardif ultimately decided if he was going to take a COVID-19 related risk, it would be while working with patients, not while playing football, said agent Sasha Ghavami.

""I'm not worried for him. He'll keep in shape and be ready to go back. He is an excellent athlete, and very committed in his approach."" Ghavami said.

25612,2020-07-26 11:36,"Armed activists demand justice in Louisville, Breonna Taylor's hometown","Hundreds of armed, predominantly Black activists demanded justice for Breonna Taylor during peaceful demonstrations on Saturday in her Kentucky hometown that drew counter-protesters from a white militia group.

Police closed streets and set up barricades to keep the two groups apart as tensions remained on edge in Louisville, where protests have flared for months over the death of Taylor, a Black woman killed when police busted into her apartment in March.

By the time Black activists dressed in black fatigues arrived in the heart of downtown Saturday afternoon, most of the white militia members had already left. Police in full riot geared looked on.

Earlier in the day, three people were accidentally shot at a park where Black activists had gathered, police said. The victims, all of whom were members of the militia group, were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.

""This is a tragic situation that could have been much worse,"" Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert Schroeder said in a news release. ""I encourage anyone choosing to exercise their Second Amendment rights to do so responsibly.""

The Black activists had converged on Louisville to demand justice for Taylor. Calls for a national reckoning over racism and police brutality intensified following the deaths of Taylor and George Floyd in Minneapolis.

""This is something that has been happening around the country for years and years and years,"" said Brianna Wright, who joined in the demonstrations Saturday.

""This is nothing new,"" she said. ""The justice we get for her will influence justice around the entire country. And if we don't get justice ... it will also influence the entire country. Because they'll think, 'It's OK, we can get away with it.' But we need to show them that Black people are not going to stand for this anymore.""

The only confrontation among the competing groups appeared to occur earlier Saturday, when white militia members and Black Lives Matter activists yelled at each other over the police barricades.

25615,2020-07-26 11:25,"Clippers' Lou Williams will quarantine, miss games after trip to favourite restauarant","The NBA said Sunday that Lou Williams of the Los Angeles Clippers is being quarantined for 10 days because of his trip out of the league's bubble last week to attend a family member's funeral.

He will miss at least two of the Clippers' seeding games, including their July 30 opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. It's possible he could miss more than two since his likely release will be Aug. 4, the day of the Clippers' third seeding game.

The issue was not that Williams left the bubble but that he also went to a club on that trip to Atlanta, and photographs of that visit — with him wearing a type of mask that the NBA distributed inside the bubble at Walt Disney World — appeared on social media.

That prompted an investigation by NBA security, and ultimately the 10-day ruling. Williams visited a club that he has often described as being his favourite restaurant, and the establishment even has chicken wings that are named for him on the menu.

But by being in a group of people and potentially exposing himself to coronavirus, the NBA decided that a longer quarantine was what's required to ensure the safety of those in the bubble.

Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans got only a four-day quarantine after leaving the bubble earlier this month for a family matter. Williamson received the shorter quarantine because was tested daily during his absence and continually was negative, plus satisfied other NBA requirements.

The Clippers were not practicing Sunday and not expected to comment on the NBA's ruling before Monday. They had 10 players available for their scrimmage game against the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. With Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley also having left the bubble for personal reasons and now Williams gone for an extended absence, they'll be short-handed for the foreseeable future as well.

""It's a challenge, you know, because we only have 10 guys,"" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Saturday night. ""That makes it really challenging. There's no breaks in practice, so you tend to not go as long. You feel like you don't get half the stuff in that you want to get in. So no, it's been a challenge. I'd love to say it hasn't been, but it's been a definite challenge.""

Williams is a Sixth Man of the Year candidate this season, averaging 18.7 points this season for the Clippers. The Clippers have secured a playoff spot and enter the restart sitting second in the Western Conference, 5 1/2 games behind the Lakers and 1 1/2 games ahead of third-place Denver.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/nba-clippers-lou-williams-quarantine-1.5663625?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,nba
25613,2020-07-26 11:03,"Former NHL forward Eddie Shack, who won 4 Stanley Cups with the Maple Leafs, dies at 83","Eddie Shack, one of the NHL's most colourful players on and off the ice, has died. He was 83.

The Toronto Maple Leafs announced the news in a tweet Sunday morning.

The Maple Leafs are deeply saddened by the passing of Eddie Shack.<br><br>A three-time all star and four-time Stanley Cup champion, Eddie entertained Leafs fans on the ice for nine seasons and for decades off of it. He will be greatly missed.<br><br>Our thoughts are with his family. <a href=""https://t.co/vMz0pznuNv"">pic.twitter.com/vMz0pznuNv</a> —@MapleLeafs

Known for his bruising style, distinctive skating gait and larger-than-life personality, Shack won four Stanley Cups with Toronto in the 1960s, including the franchise's last victory in 1967.

Nicknamed ""The Entertainer"" — with his trademark cowboy hat and luxurious moustache — he scored the winning goal for the Leafs in the 1963 final.

The native of Sudbury, Ont., played parts of 17 seasons from 1958 through 1975 with six different teams, including nine years with the Maple Leafs.

Shack collected 239 goals, 465 points and 1,431 penalty minutes in 1,047 NHL games. The winger added six goals and seven assists and 151 penalty minutes in 74 playoff contests.

In October 2016, Shack was listed as No. 68 on The One Hundred, a list of the 100 greatest Leafs that was released as part of the team's centennial anniversary.

Shack was no ordinary player

Not many hockey players are celebrated in a song or top the charts. But Shack was no ordinary hockey player.

Clear the Track by Douglas Rankine with The Secrets, started: ""Clear the track, here comes Shack. He knocks 'em down and he gives 'em a whack. He can score goals, he's got a knack. Eddie, Eddie Shack.""

The song, the brainchild of broadcaster Brian McFarlane, debuted in February 1966 and topped the Toronto music chart.

Shack was a bull in a china shop and took a toll on the opposition, knocking out Gordie Howe twice. But he recalled striking a deal with the legendary Howe that ended their on-ice hostilities when they met at a golf tournament in Vermont.

They agreed not to hit each other from then on, shaking hands on it.

Shack recalled Jean Beliveau asking him why he would hit him and then apologize.

""I said, 'Jean, sometimes I lie,""' he said with a laugh in a TV interview in November 2019.

But Shack also knew when he was outmatched, famously skating away from Bob Kelly and the Plager brothers in a game against St. Louis in the early 70s.

Won 4 Stanley Cups with Maple Leafs

Shack drifted away from the Leafs' organization after retiring, but like many players from the team's 1960s dynasty, had returned to the fold in recent years.

Born to Ukrainian immigrants on Feb. 11, 1937, Shack was working at a butcher's shop in Sudbury when he tried out for the Guelph Biltmores of the Ontario Hockey Association. He went to play five seasons for the Biltmores and one for the AHL Providence Reds before signing with the New York Rangers, the Biltmores' parent club.

Shack made his NHL debut in 1958 and was traded to Toronto in 1960 after refusing to go to Detroit.

He won the Cup with the Leafs in 1962, '63, '64 and '67.

Shack scored a career-high 26 goals with Toronto in 1966, but was traded to the Boston Bruins the next spring following the Leafs' final Cup win. He would go on to play with the Los Angeles Kings, Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins before returning to Toronto for two final seasons.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/eddie-shack-dies-fomer-toronto-maple-leafs-1.5663614?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
25611,2020-07-26 9:46,Simona Halep withdraws from Palermo Open after quarantine order,"Second-ranked Simona Halep withdrew from the Palermo Ladies Open Sunday following a quarantine ordinance issued by Italy's health ministry.

""Given the recent rise in Covid19 cases in Romania and my anxieties around international air travel at this time, I have made the tough decision to withdraw from Palermo,"" Halep tweeted. ""I want to thank the tournament director and the Italian ministry of health for all efforts on my behalf.""

The Aug. 3-9 tournament announced Sunday that the Romanian player's manager, Virginia Ruzici, had informed Palermo officials of the decision.

The move comes after Italy's health minister on Friday signed an ordinance requiring all those who have in the last 14 days stayed in Romania or Bulgaria to quarantine.

'We are disheartened and deeply upset'

""We were filled with regret when informed of the news,"" tournament director Oliviero Palma said. ""We had informed Halep's staff in detail about the fact that professional players shouldn't have to go into quarantine.

""But nevertheless Halep's staff informed us when their decision was already taken. We are disheartened and deeply upset,"" Palma added.

Palma also said that a regional health minister had sent Halep a notice explaining that the government ordinance does not apply to workers, and therefore to professional athletes.

Halep was going to be the headline player for the clay-court tournament, the first professional tour-level tennis event following a five-month break for the coronavirus pandemic.

On Saturday night, Osborne held a vigil at the spot where her daughter was last seen — the corner of Selkirk Avenue and King Street and opened the ceremony with drumming, an honour song and smudging.

They've done this annually for the last 10 years.

25608,2020-07-26 8:00,'I'm leaving a legacy': 1st translator completes stories for Indigenous archives project,"Three years and countless hours of audio material later, Bertha Catholique is the first of 17 people to finish translating stories in her language for the CBC's Indigenous languages archives project.

""I feel like I'm leaving a legacy behind as ... a language keeper and a teacher,"" said Catholique, who is originally from Łútselk'e and speaks Dënësųłinë́ — or Chipewyan.

""I've always been working with my language, and I'm so passionate for my language.""

Catholique says she clocked about 3,500 stories from the archives, which she translated into English. Some of the oldest material she worked on dates back to the early 1970s.

The translators, in Yellowknife, Iqaluit, Whitehorse, Montreal and Toronto, have been working for about three years to preserve and archive 75,000 hours worth of recorded stories collected over six decades in eight Indigenous languages: Gwich'in, Inuvialuktun, Tłı̨chǫ​,​​​ North Slavey, South Slavey, Dënësųłinë́, Cree and Inuktitut.

Among the stories Catholique translated was one she first heard as a child.

In it, her late auntie recalls going out trapping with her family — something they did every spring. But during this particular trip, Catholique's cousin suddenly heard the sound of an airplane while out playing, and discovered it had crashed.

When the family went to investigate, they found a mother who had been killed. But, miraculously, her baby was still alive.

""I always wanted to know the real truth, and she told the truth and I recorded it,"" said Catholique. ""So that really stood out in my mind.""

That's not the only time Catholique has heard a familiar voice on the old tapes. She recognized many people — from cousins, to uncles, to friends.

""The only people that I didn't really know [were] people from [the] Saskatchewan area,"" she said. ""But it's funny — I got to know them through their stories.""

Love for language began in childhood

Catholique has been a translator of sorts since she was a kid.

When her family moved from Łútselk'e to Yellowknife when she was young, she learned to speak Tłı̨chǫ. Her mother also taught her English.

""My dad, he always encouraged me, telling me to go to school to learn the language because he didn't know how to read and write in English. So I taught him how to write his name,"" she said.

""I always interpreted for him then. So ever since then I just thought, 'OK, well I'll just go with the language.' And I love doing it too.""

But it's no walk in the park; translating is hard work, Catholique says.

At times, she'd find herself stuck on a word. However, she says she could always find help from the other archivists — even those who don't speak Chipewyan.

""Because we all are originally from the land, even though we have different languages, we all still have the same lifestyle. So that's how we're helping each other,"" she explained.

""Tłı̨chǫ and Chipewyan are almost really close. [Another translator] would say something in Tłı̨chǫ language, and then that's how I'd pick it up.""

Especially when the elders are telling you a joke in their language, it's more funny if you really understand. - Bertha Catholique

There were moments of humour too.

""Especially when the elders are telling you a joke in their language, it's more funny if you really understand,"" Catholique said. ""That's what I like about it.""

6 decades, 8 languages, 75,000 hours

The CBC's Indigenous languages archives project is not only a way to preserve the intricate history of the North and its people, but to share it with the rest of the world.

Stories are being digitized from reel-to-reel tape that has been deteriorating over the years — some of it dating back to the 1950s. The hope is to eventually make the recordings available online through different organizations.

It's still like, I can't believe it, like, I did it all by myself. - Bertha Catholique

Catholique says she didn't know much about cataloguing when she first got the job. Now, with thousands of stories under her belt, she's proud of her work.

""It's still like, I can't believe it, like, I did it all by myself,"" she said.

She also has a message for others, which she originally shared in her own language.

""I just told them that it's really good to be educated, to go to school and also hang on to your language,"" she said. ""Because the language makes you a person who you are, and you're stronger if you can speak your language well.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bertha-catholique-indigenous-archives-project-complete-1.5660440?cmp=rss,news,canada,north

Health experts ask Ottawa to decide on funding domestic vaccine trial.

Ottawa says COVID-19 tracing app now in beta testing.

Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro says he's now negative for COVID-19.

South Korean baseball fans flocked to stadiums on Sunday for the first time this year, happy and excited even as they sat apart from relatives and friends to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The country's baseball league kicked off its season in May after a five-week delay but without spectators because of COVID-19, which has all but wiped out the global sporting calendar.

The government decided on Friday that some fans can go back, with 10 per cent of seats available at Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) games from Sunday.

All fans have to wear masks, have their temperatures checked, provide contact details and socially distance in the stands. No food or alcohol is allowed, meaning no sales of fan favourites, beer and chicken.

Tickets for the 2,424 seats up for grabs sold out in 25 minutes, said an official with the Doosan Bears, who were up against the LG Twins on Sunday.

South Korea reported 113 new cases on Saturday — the largest single-day increase in almost four months.

As of Sunday morning, the global coronavirus case count topped 16 million, with more than 644,000 deaths due to the virus and 9.2 million cases considered recovered, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

In North Korea, leader Kim Jong-un has declared an emergency and lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of being infected with the coronavirus returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border, state media said on Sunday.

If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities.

Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a ""critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country,"" the North's KCNA state news reported.

A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, KCNA reported.

U.K. defends Spain travel rule

In Britain, meanwhile, the country's foreign secretary defended the government's decision to immediately impose a 14-day quarantine for U.K. travellers returning from Spain, saying it just wasn't possible to give them more notice.

Dominic Raab told Sky News that vague advice would have created more uncertainty. He said that the government must be able to take quick action to fight the virus.

The quick decision threw the plans of thousands into chaos — many of whom were startled to see such a decision imposed so quickly.

Zeta Hill is among them. The teacher from Essex in southeast England had been on holiday in Mallorca for 12 days and is due to fly back on Tuesday.

She said that while she knew she was taking a risk, the Balearic islands haven't been as badly affected as other parts of Spain.

Canadian charities are seeing a major drop in fundraising and participation in their running events due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Public health orders have restricted large gatherings of people throughout the spring and summer, so charities like the Canadian Cancer Society can't hold formal events like the Run for the Cure — with opening and closing events or an official race day.

The organization says it has half the participation in its runs compared to this time last year and expects to bring in half as much revenue.

Ontario reported 138 new cases on Saturday for a total of 38,543. Thirty-three of those cases were in the Windsor-Essex area, which posted the highest number of new infections in the province on Friday — 57 cases — a majority of them involving agri-food workers.

Health officials in British Columbia have announced a new community outbreak of COVID-19 in Haida Gwaii. Until now, the remote islands have managed to avoid any cases, but 13 local residents have now tested positive.

What's happening in the rest of the world

Australia's second-most populous state, Victoria, recorded 459 cases of the new coronavirus, the second-highest daily total and up from 357 cases the previous day, the state's leader said on Sunday.

Premier Daniel Andrews also told a news briefing that Victoria had reported 10 COVID-19 deaths in past 24 hours, Australia's highest ever daily number.

The state's second wave is being driven by workplace infections, including at aged-care and healthcare facilities, big distribution centres, slaughterhouses, cold-storage facilities and warehouses, Andrews said.

""What that tells you is that some people... are feeling sick, they have symptoms and they are still going to work,"" he said. ""If that continues, then we will just continue to see more and more cases.""

Australia has avoided the worst of coronavirus crisis seen in other countries, but authorities are struggling to contain an outbreak in Victoria. It has recorded more than 14,400 cases so far.

In Japan, officials confirmed 239 new coronavirus infections in Tokyo on Sunday as the capital struggled with a resurgence in cases after the government lifted a state of emergency. The total marks the sixth straight day new cases in the city have exceeded 200.

While Japan was spared the kind of surge in infections that have killed tens of thousands in other countries, Tokyo has raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after a series of new cases.

In the United States, parents are trying to decide how their children will learn this fall amid the pandemic, weighing the benefits of in-person instruction against the risks that schools could shut their doors again or that their children could contract the virus and pass it on.

About 70 per cent of Americans surveyed for a recent poll think schools should open in the fall, though most of those think it should happen with restrictions.

According to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. only eight per cent of participants said schools should operate normally.

The U.S. leads the world with more than 4.1 million confirmed infections and over 146,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, more than 15.7 million infections and over 640,000 deaths have been reported.

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro says he has tested negative for the coronavirus. That's based on a fourth test since announcing July 7 he had the virus.

In Africa, the continent's total confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 800,000.

That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

South Africa has more than half the reported cases on the continent. But infections are now climbing rapidly in other countries, including Kenya, East Africa's economic hub, with more than 16,000.

China, where COVID-19 first emerged late last year, reported 46 new cases on Sunday, the highest daily tally in more than a month.

Authorities confirmed 22 cases in Urumqi, a city in the Xinjiang region in the country's far west, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

That raised the total in the local outbreak to 137 since the first case was detected 10 days ago. Another 13 cases were confirmed in Liaoning province in the northeast, bringing the total there to 25, almost all in the city of Dalian.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-july-26-covid-19-1.5663538?cmp=rss,news,world,
25606,2020-07-26 7:00,Learning language through whispers: Indigenous youth launch ASMR campaign,"Inspired by the concept of ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response), a group of Indigenous youth in Montreal are hoping to calm their peers throughout the global coronavirus pandemic with words and phrases in Indigenous languages.

It's called Indigenous Whispers.

""I love ASMR. Everytime I watch ASMR, I feel calm and it helps me fall asleep,"" said Kijâtai Veillette-Cheezo, a member of Native Montreal Youth Council, who launched the project.

""For me, it makes me feel calm and I'm really anxious these days so I watch ASMR and I want some Indigenous representation in the ASMR community.""

Native Montreal Youth Council is comprised of 10 Indigenous youth aged 16 to 30 living in the Greater Montreal Area. Every year their mandate is to work on a project as a group that impacts and touches the lives of Indigenous youth in the city, said Meropi Deligianis, a youth intervention worker at Native Montreal.

'We can do something together'

As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic quashed the group's original plans, they came up with the idea for the social media campaign that aims to promote relaxation, reassurance and safety by sharing the beauty and diversity of Indigenous languages through ASMR techniques.

""It's powwow season right now. It's the season of gathering and seeing each other. A lot of people are missing that,"" said Veillette-Cheezo.

""I see people around me feeling sad because they can't meet other people, and I feel the same way. We wanted to find a way to reach everyone, to let everyone know that we're not alone in this and that we can do something together.""

Veillette-Cheezo, whose family is from Lac Simon First Nation, is relearning the dialect of Anishinaabemowin used among Algonquin communities in Quebec. She used the word adjidjimoc, which means squirrel, for her submission to the project.

Youth council member Johnny Boivin had to do research into his own language — Innu-Aimun — for the project, and ended up selecting nikatshipanu to go with video him and his wife captured of a train rolling along the tracks.

""It means something that goes slowly or that advances slowly,"" said Boivin. ""I'm not fluent at all in Innu-Aimun and I have a lot to learn.""

Indigenous youth are encouraged to participate in campaign by posting a video of their own words or phrases to social media with #Indigenouswhispers or #Chuchoteursautochtones .

Boivin said he's hoping to see participation outside of Quebec, and is excited to hear other Indigenous languages from across North America as well as people who are at different levels of their language reclamation journey.

""Indigenous representation is really important, and it's such a unique project,"" he said. ""We might have fluent people or people who are saying a word out loud for the first time in their language. It's going to be really nice to share this and to be able to help each other in learning.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/indigenous-whispers-asmr-campaign-shares-language-1.5662153?cmp=rss,news,indigenous,
25607,2020-07-26 7:00,"For Regina's Sillinger brothers, COVID-19 means training together for pivotal but uncertain hockey season","A dozen hockey players, ages 17 to 22, happily hammer through their off-season workout routine. They quickly maneuver between barbell racks, resistance band exercises and dynamic stretching. It's an unusually wet and muggy day in Regina, which means the air inside Level 10 Fitness is even thicker.

The clanging of weights, the constant chatter and healthy competition is a welcomed return to normalcy for the Sillinger brothers — even though experiencing all of these elements together, in their hometown of Regina, is anything but.

""This is the longest I've been with my family since I left to play junior hockey four years ago,"" said 22-year-old Owen Sillinger.

Owen, Lukas, 19, and Cole, 17, haven't been at home this long as a trio since they were young kids. But just as the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted their fledgling hockey careers, so did it bring the Sillinger family together.

The journey home

The off-season began early and with great disappointment for the three brothers.

Owen was completing his sophomore season at Bemidji State in Minnesota, Lukas was in his final season with the Penticton Vees of the BCHL, and in Medicine Hat, Alta., Cole was having a fantastic rookie year with the Tigers of the WHL.

That's when the long and winding journey began for the siblings, as well as their parents, Karla and Mike, who were at their winter home in Phoenix, Ariz., when the pandemic set in.

""My wife, she said once they close Disneyland, we're out of here,"" Mike recalled.

By the time they hit the road, they had received word their sons were being sent home, too.

Bemidji State was preparing for its WCHA semi-final series. With a win, the Beavers would all but lock up a spot in the NCAA Hockey Tournament. But all of it ended just before the first game was set to begin in mid-March.

""We got a phone call later that afternoon when all the guys were going out for lunch and they said, ""Sorry, guys, and everything is shutting down,"" said Owen.

In Penticton, B.C., the Vees had their season cancelled as a part of Hockey Canada's decision to end all hockey on March 12.

Meanwhile in Medicine Hat, the WHL postponed its season that same day before officially cancelling on March 18.

Riding out the pandemic

When all five Sillingers converged at home in Regina, they had to quarantine together for two weeks, then ride out the pandemic. It meant adjustments on many levels.

""At the start they weren't quite sure what was going to happen, and when the seasons were cancelled you can see you start butting heads, you know, getting a little restless,"" Mike said.

Everything is a competition for the brothers: working out, golf, video games and, of course, hockey.

""There's a few fights here and there, but mom always seems to break those up,"" Lukas said with a wry grin.

The Sillinger boys have appreciated having their parents and one another to lean on during the pandemic. (Submitted by the Sillinger family)

""Sometimes I get in there and I start butting heads, too, and I start turning her cranks and teasing and whatnot,"" Mike said with a laugh.

""So, she kind of keeps us all under control.""

Mike refers to Karla as the ""true hero"" in the family, not only for her United Nations-level peacekeeping efforts but also for her cooking. Her and Mike have had to contend with the sticker shock of feeding three male athletes who train daily. It's given them a greater appreciation for billet family's financial needs.

From zooming on the ice to Zoom workouts

With the boys' seasons abruptly coming to an end, there was an itch to get back to training faster than usual. They would typically head to Level 10 to begin the process of getting back on the ice. But, like the rest of us, Owen, Lukas and Cole were confined to their house.

That's where video hockey training came in.

""We'd all be in our basement and just kind of we'd have the camera on or Zoom and just do the jumping squatting and kind of lunges, bodyweight stuff,"" explained Cole.

It's not just the Sillingers that are at the elite level of hockey in Regina. The city is home to more than a dozen players in their age group who are playing either junior or college hockey. This group all work out together at Level 10, giving the Sillinger brothers a good push from peers.

Leaning on each other

Having elite level hockey playing siblings to lean on, a father who had an accomplished NHL career and a mom who runs the household has been the Sillinger boys' biggest assets.

""They make it so easy just to kind of you know lean on them if I need something or if they need something,"" said Owen.

Lukas pointed out that having a dad with Mike's experience in the NHL lends itself to lots of tips. Mike had a long and winding 17-year career in the league, covering 15 teams. If there is anything that has happened in hockey, it has happened to Mike, and as a parent, he has passed on a lot of that advice.

This has allowed Owen, Lukas and Cole to carve out their own hockey-playing path.

""I think what you have to do as parents is give them their options and being involved in hockey for many years you know I had the resources to give them their best options,"" Mike said.

Season in doubt

Being that resource may be more important now than ever before, as his sons prepare for what could be the most important season of their young hockey careers — one that is facing so much uncertainty.

The National Hockey League will resume the 2019-20 season on Aug. 1, but other levels of hockey are still in limbo for the upcoming season.

The extended off-season has been extra hard on Cole. He was named to play for Team Canada at the annual Hlinka Gretzky Cup international summer tournament. It is a showcase for the top U-18 players in the world. The majority of the players would be draft eligible in 2021 and Cole is potentially one of the top forwards for Canada.

""It's a tough opportunity. Any time you get recognized to play for Team Canada, you want to put on a jersey and actually be a part of the event,"" Cole said.

""You see many things are getting cancelled right now. I think it's just the way the world's gone.""

Lukas plans to join Owen for his first season at Bemidji State after a great career with Penticton. He will have the added pressure of being a fulltime student and a NCAA hockey player.

""Going to school and practising each and every day is gonna be an adjustment, but I'm really looking forward to it,"" Lukas said.

In less than a month, they were set to make their way back to Minnesota, but there is some doubt creeping in as word is still out on the NCAA.

""I'm not really kind of sure how it's going to handle itself,"" said Owen.

The trio is taking things the whole situation in stride, considering.

""For myself, and even Lukas and O, we train as hard as we can in the summer, you know, all summer and it doesn't really matter to me when the season is going to start,"" Cole said. ""I just know me personally and my goal is to just be in the best shape and work on the things I need to work on so I can be the best player I can be for when the season does start.""

The work the three of them put in now could pay dividends in their hockey future.

With the NHL draft looming next spring and the potential of being a day-one draft pick, there has already been a lot of praise heaped on Cole. The young forward isn't feeling any of the effects of what is ahead.

""Obviously I want to get drafted: that's the end goal,"" Cole said. ""I want to be a high pick and being a first-rounder is my goal.""

The same could be said for Owen. Entering his third season at Bemidji State means his collegiate career will soon be behind him and the potential for a pro career lies ahead.

""I really don't want to look too far ahead; I kind of want to enjoy where I'm at,"" Owen said.

Mike is now retired and one of his favourite things is travelling with Karla to watch his sons play hockey. He knows there is nothing anyone can do with the unpredictability of the pandemic and its effect on the upcoming season.

25596,2020-07-26 6:00,Sask. Party's quest for 4th term in power could put it in rare company,"When Saskatchewan voters are called to the polls in three months, Premier Scott Moe will be seeking a fourth consecutive term in government for his Saskatchewan Party. The polls suggest he's likely to get it. It would be a win that most governing parties in Canada have failed to secure in the past.

First elected in 2007, the Sask. Party is the longest-serving provincial government in Canada. That alone is exceptional, considering the amount of changeover in recent years in Canadian politics. Only the Sask. Party and the Nova Scotia Liberals — first elected in 2013 — have been in power for more than five consecutive years.

With the brief exception of a few months in 2017, just before the resignation of then-premier Brad Wall, the Sask. Party's lead in the polls over the New Democrats has been wide and relatively consistent since Wall's first term in the job.

Ahead of this fall's election, the Sask. Party is outfundraising the NDP and Moe's personal approval ratings remain high. Two polls conducted at the end of the spring found two-thirds of respondents in the province approving of the premier's performance.

So, barring an upset in October, the Sask. Party is likely to win its fourth consecutive election. That doesn't happen for most parties.

Since Confederation, only about half of provincial or federal parties have survived long enough in government to even get a crack at a fourth term and just one-third of governing parties have been able to put together a winning streak of four elections. Most either fail in that fourth attempt or have already fallen by the wayside.

From there, survival gets harder and harder. Less than one-in-10 governing parties have made it beyond six terms.

This means that if Moe is able to make good on his party's strong polling numbers, he will be in rare company.

The benefits of incumbency

In any given election, the incumbent party is more likely to win than lose. Throughout Canadian history, the governing party has won slightly more than 69 per cent of the time. The odds are stacked in the governing party's favour for several reasons, not least of which is that if voters thought a party was good enough to govern last time, chances are they still feel that way.

That is especially the case if it is not only the same party but the same premier seeking re-election. Incumbent parties running with the same leader as the previous election have won about 75 per cent of the time, compared to just 56 per cent of the time when incumbent parties have someone new at the helm.

This should not come as a surprise. Popular parties tend to keep their popular leaders around. Unpopular leaders tend to resign and a fresh face isn't always enough to turn the tide of public opinion.

That isn't quite what is going on in Saskatchewan. Though the party's support and Wall's personal approval ratings were dipping in 2017, the Sask. Party was still leading the NDP in most polls and Wall was still one of the most popular premiers in the country.

Wall stepped aside before he risked overstaying his welcome, handing over a party in good shape to his successor. Since Moe took over in early 2018, no poll has put the party ahead of the NDP by anything less than double-digits.

Moe trying to add name to list of past four-timers

There haven't been many four-term governments in Saskatchewan's history. Only four governing parties have attempted a fourth-consecutive election victory and only three have managed to get it.

The first was William Martin's Liberal government in 1917. In that wartime election, Saskatchewan's voters — including, for the first time, women — re-elected the only government they had ever known since becoming a province in 1905. This was Martin's first election as premier, however, as he had replaced Saskatchewan's first premier, Walter Scott, in 1916.

The first leader to seek and win a fourth consecutive term was Tommy Douglas. Elected in 1944 at the head of Canada's first CCF government, Douglas won re-election in 1948, 1952 and 1956. He would lead the CCF to one more election victory in 1960 before making the jump to the leadership of the federal NDP.

Tommy Douglas won five consecutive elections between 1944 and 1960 as leader of the Saskatchewan CCF.

Allan Blakeney, leader of the Saskatchewan NDP from 1970 to 1987, was the only premier to fight for a fourth term and lose. After winning three elections in the 1970s, the pre-campaign polls gave Blakeney good odds of winning a fourth in 1982. Instead, the NDP went down to a big defeat and were replaced by Grant Devine's Progressive Conservatives.

The fourth and last time a party sought a fourth consecutive term in office was in 2003. This was Lorne Calvert's first campaign as premier and NDP leader after he replaced Roy Romanow in 2001. Calvert's NDP barely held on, winning only two more seats than the Sask. Party under Elwin Hermanson. Calvert would lose the next election to Wall in 2007 — beginning the Sask. Party's current run in power.

It has been an electorally successful run. The Sask. Party increased its seat edge over the NDP in both the 2011 and 2016 elections, winning the popular vote by 32 percentage points each time.

The polls suggest the Sask. Party is on track for another victory in three months. But considering the record of governments past, a win being predictable doesn't make it any less impressive.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/grenier-saskatchewan-election-history-1.5660835?cmp=rss,news,canada,saskatchewan
25600,2020-07-26 5:44,"Portland racial injustice protesters breach fence, police declare riot","Authorities declared a riot early Sunday in Portland, Ore., where protesters breached a fence surrounding the city's federal courthouse building where U.S. agents have been stationed.

Police described via Twitter the ""violent conduct of people downtown"" as creating a ""grave risk of public alarm."" Police demanded people leave the area surrounding the courthouse, around 1:20 a.m. Sunday, and said that those who fail to adhere may be arrested or subjection to tear gas and impact weapons.

By 1:40 p.m., both federal officers and Portland police could be seen on the streets, surrounding the courthouse, attempting to clear the area and deploying tear gas.

In the hours leading up to the declared riot, thousands of people gathered in the city Saturday evening for another night of protests as demonstrations over George Floyd's killing and the presence of federal agents sent by U.S. President Donald Trump showed no signs of abating.

Crowds began to march toward the city's federal courthouse around 9:15 p.m., some marching from eight kilometres away. A big group of demonstrators in the North Portland neighbourhood also paraded by the police precinct there, which was roped off and had officers in riot gear standing outside the building.

They paused outside a downtown hotel, where federal agents are staying, chanting ""Feds go home"" and yelling the names of Black people killed by police.

As protesters marched down the streets, the Portland Police Bureau posted on social media for people to not walk or block the street as they may be subject to charges such as disorderly conduct and interfering with peace officers.

Hundreds of others crossed the Steel Bridge around 11 p.m. to the courthouse, meeting up with thousands of people that had already been tear-gassed by federal agents.

The fence surrounding the building had flowers and banners draped across as federal agents emerged from the courthouse to inspect it. They were met with fireworks shot over the fence.

Federal agents tossed canisters of tear gas at the crowd, while people ran toward the plumes, picked up some of the canisters and threw them back over the fence.

As some protesters attempted to cut the fence using power tools, streams of pepper spray were spewed at the crowd.

WATCH | Fireworks and tear gas in Portland:

Protesters and federal agents clashed again into the early hours of Saturday outside a Portland, Ore., courthouse. 2:24

At the nearby Justice Center, images and words were projected onto the building including ""Keep fighting. Keep pushing.""

During demonstrations the previous night federal agents repeatedly fired tear gas to break up rowdy protests that continued into the early morning Saturday. Authorities say six federal officers were injured and one person was arrested.

Demonstrations have happened in Oregon's largest city nightly for two months since Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in May. Trump said he sent federal agents to Portland to halt the unrest but state and local officials say they are making the situation worse.

There were demonstrations for police reform and against the increased presence of federal law enforcement in cities across the country Saturday. In Seattle, police declared a riot Saturday afternoon following large demonstrations and deployed flash bangs and pepper spray to try to clear crowds. Authorities made more than 40 arrests said 21 officers suffered mostly minor injuries.

Chuck Lovell, the Portland police chief, released a video message on social media Saturday night calling for peace.

""Across the country people are committing violence, supposedly in support of Portland,"" Lovell said. ""If you want to support Portland then stop the violence, work for peace. Portland police officers and police facilities have been threatened.

""Now more than ever, Portland police need your support. We want to be with you in the community and working on the real relationships that will create change. We want to get back to the critical issues that have been hijacked by people committing crimes under the cover of the crowds.""

Late Friday, a federal judge denied a request by Oregon's attorney general to restrict the actions of federal police.

The Federal Protective Service had declared the gathering in Portland that began Friday evening an unlawful assembly. Harry Fones, a Homeland Security spokesperson, said at a news conference Saturday afternoon some people launched large fireworks, threw hard projectiles and used power tools to damage property.

He said one person was arrested for failing to comply with orders. That person was later released without charges, bringing the total number of people arrested on or near the courthouse property since early July to 60.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/portland-protest-1.5663531?cmp=rss,news,world,
25614,2020-07-26 5:00,N.S. artists call for new voice to represent urban music industry,"Artists in Nova Scotia's urban scene are pushing for a new association to better support and recognize their work, claiming existing organizations are failing them.

Conversations around whether groups like the East Coast Music Awards properly reflect the local industry have been circulating since only about 15 per cent of the 2020 music category winners were women.

Corey Writes, a Halifax hip-hop artist and songwriter is also speaking up. He said the ECMAs and Music Nova Scotia don't recognize the new acts in urban music, including rap, hip-hop and R&B, and people in their genre find it harder to access funding.

""I would like to think it's not done purposefully,"" Writes told CBC's Information Morning recently.

Some Black Nova Scotian musicians say they don't get enough recognition from the ECMAs or Music Nova Scotia. Now a recording artist from Uniacke Square wants to start a music association that would focus on hip hop and R&B. 7:59

He said it might be ignorance. He said the province's Celtic tradition means many associate local music with fiddles and tartan.

""You're going to represent your heritage, I get it. But at the same time, you've got to … share the platform with everyone and [equally] distribute it.""

Writes said he's found that even when there are hip-hop showcases at the ECMAs or Nova Scotia Music Week, they are often in much smaller venues than other genres, or in ones further away from the main stages.

Association would include musicians, dancers, and more

He is now calling on people within Nova Scotia's urban music and art scene to come together and form their own association, which could include musicians, promoters and those who are into slam poetry or dance.

By forming such a group, Writes hopes they could bring the urban scene to the forefront and inspire those who might still be singing in the shower, or feel like there's no point in trying to break into the industry.

""I think about all the artists that just stopped working because they couldn't get grants and stuff like that,"" Writes said. ""And it's just unfair. It just seems like the same grants go to the same people over and over and over.""

Dean Stairs, chair of the ECMA board of directors, said in an email that the association connects with emerging artists across all genres.

He said it is also ""always looking to grow our membership in meaningful and productive ways and continue to assess how to best do this on a year-to-year basis.""

He said they ""strongly encourage"" any initiative in support of East Coast artists and would welcome any potential collaboration with a new urban music organization.

Long struggle

For Brian Pelrine, an artist in Halifax for more than 20 years who goes by Dj IV professionally, the fight to have the scene better represented in the province has been a long one.

Pelrine said about three years ago he and fellow hip-hop artist J-Bru (Jason Bruce) wanted to form a Maritime urban music association.

Brian Pelrine appears in a screen capture from a Classified music video. (YouTube/Half Life Records Inc./Sony Music Entertainment Canada)

After he spoke with CBC about the idea, Pelrine said he got a call from the director of Music Nova Scotia at the time who wanted to set up a meeting.

""They kind of just gave us a lot of lip service about like, 'You know, it's going to take years to acquire funding. There's no sense in you guys starting your own organization, come over here and align with us,'"" Pelrine said.

But Pelrine said after they came up with a list of ideas, almost all were shot down. An urban music committee was established and got a non-voting seat on the board, but Pelerine said nothing concrete came of it.

It's unfortunate, because Pelrine said their committee had gathered people from ""every aspect"" of their community, including R&B singers, electronic producers, DJs, Indigenous artists, and more.

Committee offered to work on outreach

A main goal they hoped to achieve was public outreach, Pelrine said, and getting into diverse communities around the province to attract new members.

""If we took our Indigenous supporters for the committee, and sent them into Indigenous communities, they would have a better shot,"" Pelrine said.

""We served it up on a platter … and that was all in the itinerary, you know. But like it was just, I don't know, just frowned upon I guess.""

Pelrine noted the director they worked with at the time is no longer in the organization.

In an email, current Music Nova Scotia president Brian Doherty said the urban advisory committee was an independent one with an appointed seat on their board of directors.

""They were encouraged to develop proposals to be submitted by Music Nova Scotia for projects they were interested in pursuing, that fit within Funding Guidelines. This independent committee decided to disband in June 2020,"" he wrote.

Doherty said Music Nova Scotia has a ""variety of initiatives"" in place to engage new artists and they recently struck new diversity, programming, and youth committees. Each of those groups are ""committed to assuring marginalized and diverse communities are represented.""

Current groups don't have 'ear to the streets'

Pelrine said his biggest hope is just for more people to support the local talent that's already doing amazing things.

He said it would be ideal to see the ECMA and Music N.S. be more proactive, since right now there's no one that has their ""ear to the streets of urban culture.""

He said right now a membership might ensure these organizations know your name, but they don't know where your music is played, how many albums, or how many Spotify followers you have.

Most end up promoting themselves online and not worrying about local accolades, Pelrine said.

For example, new hip-hop duo Atay & JAX put out their first album last year under JAX's name and got about 40,000 downloads in one weekend, he noted. They weren't nominated for an ECMA this year but are ""obviously doing something right,"" Pelrine said.

To the average person, Pelrine said he's sure they see Classified performing at an awards show and assume the existing organizations are doing something — ""but it's just not enough.""

""I think we're beyond working with the existing associations at this point,"" Pelrine said, adding that it would be best to start a fresh new organization because urban music will never be a focus for the other groups.

25592,2020-07-26 4:00,Honey Badgers coach Schmidt leans on personal experience to connect with players,"It isn't in Ryan Schmidt's nature to talk about himself.

The marriage between humble and confident is an organic one, years in the making. His successes, a list longer than the Hamilton Honey Badgers' 12-man roster, do not define him.

There is no air of pompousness when he speaks to his players, nor does he approach coaching with the mentality that basketball was better back when he played professionally.

Instead, it is his lowest moments, his personal and professional pitfalls that he draws inspiration from.

Schmidt knows the X's and O's of basketball as well as any coach. His time with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Raptors 905 can attest to this.

WATCH | CEBL's return to play plan:

The CEBL is the first league in Canada to start up again during the pandemic, but how did they do it? 1:29

He can run plays and exploit weaknesses in opponents. His eye for the game isn't the reason Jerry Stackhouse kept him in mind for the Raptors 905.

It isn't why Canada's Jermaine Anderson, who, under any other circumstance, would have likely never crossed paths with the Keizer, Oregon native, knew who he wanted for head coach of the Hamilton Honey Badgers when he was named General Manager of the team.

Schmidt's ""player-first"" coaching strategy, lauded by some and criticized by others, is his alone, but over the course of the CEBL Summer Series, it will become shared by the team. It is unique to him, because it is painted with the brushes of his own life and career, but it is the common ground he will find with his players, each of whom he sees remnants of himself in.

""I didn't really have a [playing] career,"" Schmidt said. ""It was something that I was chasing after, but I didn't have the career that I wanted and I realized how hard it is to not only to make it professionally but to have a long, sustainable career.

""I think my outlook as far as knowing what [the players] are going through and what they want, and knowing how hard it is, gives me a different perspective because I worked for [Jerry Stackhouse] who had an 18-year NBA career.""

Lifelong passion for basketball

From two years old, his passion for basketball was obvious. He tried other sports, like baseball, and was heavily recruited as a football player in high school.

His decision to forgo football scholarships, instead attending community college for basketball, may have been puzzling to others, but to Schmidt it was clear. He was great at football, but it didn't ignite the fire in him that basketball did.

Growing another few inches certainly helped propel him toward his basketball dreams, ultimately accepting a scholarship to the University of Hawaii.

A star in Hawaii, he returned to his home state after his sophomore season to finish his collegiate career at Western Oregon University.

When he was drafted into the NBA D-League (now G-League) in 2008, Schmidt was steps away from his goal of playing on the biggest stage, hoping to join the list of players who have forged a career from D-League beginnings.

Achieving his dreams, however realistic, was never linear. From 2008-2010 the ebbs and flows of his career saw him bouncing between the D-League and the ABA (American Basketball Association).

Schmidt's chance at impressing an NBA team narrowed quickly, and the injuries he suffered forced him to face his harshest reality: his professional playing career was over before it began.

""You have to be professional,"" Schmidt said. ""You have to take care of your body and build good habits. That's something I [ask] the guys all the time, 'do your habits match your goals?'

""These players have goals, whether it be to play in the NBA or high-level Europe, and from me, knowing where I was and how it didn't happen, that's one thing I've always said too. I don't look back on my playing days and regret anything.""

A new basketball experience captured in a stylistic, fun, energetic, and yet powerful manner. This will be the CEBL war cry. The start of the CEBL Summer Series. Start of a new journey. Start of #OurGame. 1:30

Returning home to Oregon and working odd jobs was not what he had predicted for his future, but then again, neither was coaching.

A family friend who ran a youth basketball camp approached Schmidt with an opportunity, unknowingly opening doors that he had never even considered, eventually leading to a head coaching position at South Carolina.

His highest highs, followed immediately by his lowest lows, led him to the CEBL.

Schmidt's personal story gives him a perspective, a closeness to his players, that other coaches haven't lived. It is these stories he will tell his players the night before the season begins, not of his successes, but of his stumblings, during Hamilton's nightly ""player talks.""

His player talks are powerpoint presentations made by players, consisting of their reason for playing, a moment of adversity they have faced, and their goals and commitments for the season. These talks give insight into who the players are off of the court, creating a bond between them that seems impossible to do in a two-week season.

But if anyone can do it, it's Ryan Schmidt. He's been there, after all.

""You have to be ready every single day because you never know, today could be the day that changes your career – for good or for bad.""

25585,2020-07-26 4:00,"A year after manhunt for teen murder suspects, some in Manitoba town are forever changed","It was an unusual sight: a barking police dog in northern Manitoba's remote dense brush and heavily armed tactical officers in camouflage as a drone flew overhead. The officers were draped in head net mesh to keep thousands of swarming bugs away.

This scene that played out a year ago this week near Gillam, Man., would mark the start of a nationwide hunt for Canada's two most wanted men — B.C. teenagers Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, and Kam McLeod, 19.

The RCMP say the teens, who were first reported as missing, murdered Chynna Deese, an American, her Australian boyfriend, Lucas Fowler, and University of British Columbia botany lecturer Leonard Dyck before going on the run — triggering what may be the largest manhunt in Canadian history.

Hundreds of RCMP officers worked on the case in Manitoba and B.C., the FBI and Australian police were involved and military aircraft were brought in.

Gillam, which has an airport, served as the base for the RCMP during the search. It's where the Mounties' detachment is located and where many officers slept. But most of the ground search took place away from the town in areas closer to the Fox Lake Cree Nation.

Mayor Dwayne Forman said for the most part, his town, located about 1,000 kilometres north of Winnipeg, has gone back to a sense of normalcy, but ""there are a few people that are still negatively affected and will always be affected by this.""

Even after the teens' bodies were found last August less than an hour's drive from the town, he said, some in the community were still scared. As an example, he pointed to a father who had never slept apart from his wife for 20 years. But once the manhunt began and the military was called in, he started sleeping in the living room with a gun.

Forman said when he talked to the man about six months after the ordeal, he was still sleeping in the living room.

""Obviously it's still in his mind and he's still under the protection mode.""

Story gripped the world

The discovery of the fugitives' bodies along the Nelson River, near the Fox Lake Cree Nation, provided a sense of relief for residents who had been looking over their shoulders for weeks.

It calmed Canadians who thought they spotted the teens in other provinces and marked the end to a story that gripped the world.

""I think it would've been a totally different scenario if they were never found. Them being found, I think, put a lot of people's minds at ease that this hopefully once-in-a-lifetime situation that happened up here, worldwide manhunt, ended with closure,"" Forman said.

But the discovery, which happened with the help of Fox Lake resident Billy Beardy, didn't provide answers to the big question: Why?

Mayor Dwayne Forman of Gillam, Man., said the manhunt has had a lasting impact on some residents of the town. (CBC)

Why gun down a loving couple — who were on vacation travelling to the Canadian Rockies in a van — in cold blood? A pathologist determined that Deese, 24, and Fowler, 23, were shot multiple times and said it appeared the shooter(s) stood behind the victims for at least some of the shots.

Why drive another seven and a half hours and shoot a third person, 64-year-old Dyck, and leave him with injuries the RCMP wouldn't release? And why go to northern Manitoba, of all places?

The bodies of Fowler and Deese were found on July 15 at the side of the Alaska Highway near Liard Hot Springs in northern B.C. Dyck's body was found four days later in a highway pullout near Dease Lake, about 500 kilometres to the southwest.

""It dumbfounds me,"" Forman said.

Finally, who was the tipster who knew the teens and alerted the RCMP in B.C. two days after they were reported missing, saying they may actually have been involved in the murders?

'It does give me chills sometimes'

Sandra Broughton, a resident of Fort Nelson, B.C., said she still wonders what would have happened if Fowler and Deese took her and her husband up on an offer of help while their van was broken down on the Alaska Highway.

""You always have the what ifs in the back of your head,"" she said.

Broughton and her husband, Curtis, who is a mechanic, were among the last people to see Deese and Fowler alive before they were gunned down. They had pulled over after spotting the young couple's van, with the hood up, on the side of the road in a remote area without cellphone service.

""It's surreal, like a weird dream in a way. You know in that moment that destiny could have been changed,"" Broughton said.

""We were there offering help and to be helpful, like being the good in the world, and yet the same day they met the worst out there in the world.""

Broughton recalls Fowler's Aussie accent while he politely turned down the couple's offer of help.

The RCMP issued a public alert for McLeod and Schmegelsky, shown on a police poster, on July 23, 2019. (Ben Nelms/CBC)

""I just remember him explaining what was wrong, like really well,"" she said, adding it later made sense when she learned he had completed a mechanic apprenticeship in high school.

A year later, Broughton said, her husband still pulls over to offer others help, and she still thinks about their interaction last summer.

""It does give me chills sometimes,"" she said.

""When I found out what happened, I knew right away that it was them. Because I had this bad feeling that as we came up to help them, somebody could pull up and harm them just as easy as somebody could help them — and that's what happened, unfortunately.""

Close-knit community has changed

In Gillam, Suman Adhikari had come up with a plan for what he would do if the murder suspects walked into the town's bar.

The bartender, who is from Nepal and is used to a military presence, recalls being surprised when police stormed into Gillam and said he was ""scared all the time.""

Officers and reporters from around the world filled the Kettle River Inn & Suites, which has a bar and beer vendor that Adhikari operates.

He said he told himself that if the teens walked in, he'd try to act normal and give them a beer while he quietly called the RCMP.

While many residents of Gillam and Fox Lake Cree Nation were staying in their homes during the manhunt, some still ventured to the bar. Adhikari said he remembers a request from one woman.

""Can you watch me, please. I don't want to walk along this road. I feel very bad. Maybe these murdering guys can do something wrong to me. Please, can you drop [me at my] house,"" he said, quoting the woman.

The request was unusual, since people in the town didn't lock their doors and were never scared to walk home from the bar.

""Gillam is like a small town, zero crime, and we know each other, and [it has a] strong community and we love each other,"" Adhikari said.

The manhunt changed that, Forman said.

""In that aspect, there are some people that have changed, that have gotten to a locking system — and that's unfortunate because being a close-knit community, we've always had that open-door policy.""

'We found them. Thank goodness'

At the time of the manhunt last year, Jane MacLatchy, the RCMP's assistant commissioner for D Division in Manitoba, had been on the job for only about six months, and it was her first major public case.

In an interview with CBC's Karen Pauls this week, the veteran officer — who joined the Mounties in 1988 in B.C. — spoke about the immense challenges posed by the search.

""There's muskeg, there's dense forests, there's swamps, there's wildlife. It was a very challenging place,"" MacLatchy said. ""And we also had people looking for these two suspects and knowing they were going into harm's way every day. So they had to take the tactical approach as well, just in case they were confronted by an armed suspect.""

When she could finally announce that the bodies of the two suspects had been found, ""it was mixed feelings really for sure,"" the officer said.

""We found them. Thank goodness. We knew there was a likelihood that they were deceased.... And if we hadn't found them ... the communities [would] be living in fear — serious, serious fear in their own homes — for who knows how long,"" she said. ""So I was really relieved that we'd found them.

As for why the murders happened, MacLatchy said, ""I'll be honest, I would like to know why those two young men decided to take the steps they took, but I don't think we ever will.""

Teens had plans to kill more people

In videos the teens made on a digital camera belonging to Dyck that the RCMP found with their bodies, they took credit for the killings and showed no remorse.

They also talked about going to Hudson Bay, where they would ""hijack"" a boat and travel to Europe or Africa.

During the start of the manhunt, it was thought Schmegelsky and McLeod might try to get on a train from Gillam to Churchill, Man., but that never happened.

Instead, they went to the fast-moving Nelson River, about eight kilometres northeast of where they burnt Dyck's Toyota RAV4.

They shaved while preparing for their own deaths and talked about their plan to kill more people. The RCMP found a full box of ammunition in a backpack belonging to McLeod six days before the suspects' bodies and two rifles were found on Aug. 7 near the Nelson River.

Internal RCMP documents obtained by CBC News list the contents of Dyck's Nikon COOLPIX camera.

The documents, obtained through an access to information request, reveal that in one video, Schmegelsky — who would have turned 19 on Aug. 4 — ""advises they have found a nice little spot by the river where they are going to shoot themselves.""

But the list of contents on the camera is heavily redacted and doesn't provide a full picture of what the RCMP found.

The fact that the suspects were armed and said they planned to kill more people is still unsettling for Forman, who gets emotional while talking about the discovery of the teens' bodies.

""I'm just thankful that no one else was hurt,"" he said. ""That was scary for me knowing how close they were to Fox Lake.""

25586,2020-07-26 4:00,The Book of Negroes is relevant now more than ever as the fight for Black rights takes centre stage,"The Book of Negroes is coming back to a TV screen near you.

The six-part miniseries, based on author Lawrence Hill's best-selling and award-winning novel, first aired on CBC back in 2015 to great acclaim from critics and audiences alike.

It tells the story of a West African-born woman named Aminata Diallo who is kidnapped as a child and forced into slavery in South Carolina.

Diallo eventually helps the British in the American Revolutionary War, getting her name in a book kept by British naval officers.

She eventually makes her way to Nova Scotia, and through her eyes, viewers relive the earliest chapter of the Black experience in Canada.

But what does this lavishly shot and passionately portrayed piece of fiction have to offer audiences now, in 2020?

With protesters in cities in Canada, the United States and around the world calling for an end to systemic racism — sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 — what makes this little-known chapter of our history relevant?

SPECIAL PROGRAM | Watch Being Black in Canada, Sunday July 26 at 7 p.m. on CBC TV and CBC Gem. Host Asha Tomlinson speaks with activists who have been a part of the Black Lives Matter movement for many years about what has changed and what now needs to happen. Also in the program, we reunite writer Lawrence Hill and stars from the cast and crew of The Book of Negroes to talk about its ongoing relevance. At 8 p.m. we start our broadcast of the series that will continue on Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on CBC TV.

Series director Clement Virgo and members of the cast sat down with CBC's Asha Tomlinson for a roundtable discussion to answer this question.

Aunjanue Ellis's searing portrayal of Diallo won her best actress honours at the Canadian Screen Awards in 2016.

For Ellis, there is a direct line between the history she helps depict on the series and what has unfolded in the wake of Floyd's killing.

""I'm still in the throes of it. It will take me several months — perhaps years — for me to have some clear words about what that did to me, she said.

""But I know what it did to my body, I know what it did to my soul. I'm interested now in what it's going to do to my mind.... I shamelessly say that The Book of Negroes is a seed for that ... because Lawrence Hill wrote that not knowing that he had George Floyd in those words that he was writing.""

For Beverly Bain, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of Toronto, a big part of the power of The Book of Negroes is the fact that it has a Black female protagonist.

Bain said it's a reminder of the role Black women have always played in anti-racism work.

""That is the history of Black women,"" she said. ""We continue to be the voice of the resistance to anti-Black racism. It reflects the fact that women have always been the leaders standing up for both Black women and Black men.""

Canadian actor Shailyn Pierre-Dixon was just 11 when she played the role of Aminata as a child. Now 17, she said being cast in The Book of Negroes has helped her navigate being a young Black woman in the current push for social change.

Pierre-Dixon said she learned little to nothing about the history of slavery in Canada in school.

""It's only because before filming I'd read the book that I was able to really immerse myself in a little bit of education on this type of topic,"" she said.

""I was never really noticing different types of micro-aggression — being able to identify these instances — before being a part of The Book of Negroes, which is why I think as a young person, it's really important for us to put this type of film out.""

The miniseries also stars a legend of stage, screen and television, Louis Gossett Jr. He plays Daddy Moses, a father figure to Aminata Diallo as she tries to build a life in Nova Scotia.

To an earlier generation of activists, he was known, among other performances, for his role as Fiddler in Roots — another iconic story, written by Alex Haley, about the history and legacy of slavery that aired as a miniseries in 1977.

The Book of Negroes, he said, is this generation's Roots.

""It's time for people to know all the stories about us, to get a picture of who we really are, as some of the stories about us have been taken out of our history books,"" Gossett said.

""Everybody needs to know about everybody. Our children need to know who they are so they can represent themselves properly.""

Oscar winner Lou Gossett Jr. talks about the importance of The Book of Negroes and other seminal shows like Roots in spreading the knowledge of Black history to a wide audience. 0:46

The U of T's Bain cautions that while it's important to know our true history, especially in times of turmoil, it's not enough.

""Too often history is seen as the past. This is the continuation of the past,"" she said.

""What we see in books and in the show is still reflected in today's practices, both at institutional and everyday levels.""

Learning about the history of slavery, Bain said, has to be accompanied by what she calls ""a simultaneous call for a change to the structures that continue to bear down on Black bodies, such as the police.""

As for Lawrence Hill, who combined his research with his imagination to create The Book of Negroes, knowing history and how it can inform the future is important.

But perhaps the most important takeaway from the miniseries today is empathy.

""Hopefully it peels back the layers and allows us to see a real person ... imaginary but sort of a real person,"" Hill told CBC's Asha Tomlinson.

""And it might inspire people today to imagine that there are real people behind this Black Lives [Matter] movement, real people who are getting shot and killed and choked to death in this country and in the United States and other parts of the world. Real people who are suffering and whose humanity needs to be recognized today.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/book-of-negroes-black-history-1.5662007?cmp=rss,news,entertainment,
25587,2020-07-26 4:00,"'I was so lucky to have him': Parents and friends recall Mohamed Sow as generous, kind-hearted","Disclaimer: The author of this article and Mohamed Sow were acquainted on Facebook through a mutual friend.

The violent death of Sidi Mohamed Sow earlier this month has left his family and friends in disbelief. The 21-year-old Toronto man was one of five people shot in a drive-by shooting in a parking lot near Jane Street and Woolner Avenue in the city's west end the night of July 10.

Mohamed, who recorded hip hop music under the name King Mo, died in hospital the following evening.

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and it's unclear whether Mohamed and the people he was with were targeted.

His parents told CBC News in an interview this week that they had no idea what might have precipitated the shooting and have received few details from police.

Coverage of Mohamed's death drew criticism after police released an old mug shot when first identifying him to press. His mother, Houleymatou Bah, told CBC News the photo is from an incident in 2012 when he was at Étienne Brûlée Junior School.

At the time, Mohamed was being bullied by some older students who, she says, tried to frame him for stealing a T-shirt at a Walmart by putting it into his backpack. Mohamed took the blame to avoid angering the bullies, but when security footage showed he didn't steal the shirt, he was taken into custody for lying to police and ended up doing some community service, said Bah.

'Mom, I will never leave you'

Originally of Guinean background, Mohamed was born in New York on Feb. 10, 1999. The family emigrated to Canada in 2000, first settling in Montreal and then Toronto in 2006, where they became active in the city's Guinean community.

Mohamed's father, Alhassane Sow, who works as an inspector at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, was president of the provincial Guinean organization L'Amicale Francophone des Guinéens et des Guinéennes de l'Ontario for 11 years. His mother works as a registered midwife.

""I was so lucky to have him. I was so happy to have him,"" she said of her only child.

""He never forgot my birthdays. He would always say, 'You [raised] me, you nurtured me, I love you, and I would never switch you for the world.'""

Bah and Alhassane Sow, Mohamed's father, near their home in the Jane and St. Clair West neighbourhood. They say they've received very little information from police about the shooting. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

Mohamed lived with his parents in their home in the Jane Street and St. Clair Avenue West neighbourhood and was fond of telling his mom only marriage or a job could lure him away.

""He would always promise me, 'Mom, I will never leave you … don't worry,'"" Bah said. ""'I will always stay with you.'""

Bah said Sow never went to bed without knowing his son was home and would always check first thing in the morning if Sow was in his bedroom sleeping.

""Whenever my husband knew he was out with his friends, he would always text him and say, 'Please, Mohamed, be safe,'"" Bah said.

Mohamed, pictured with his father, graduated from Runnymede Collegiate Institute in 2017 but also attended École Secondaire Toronto Ouest. (Submitted by the Sow family)

The night of the shooting, Mohamed told his parents he would be playing basketball with some friends as he had been doing every Friday during the pandemic. Sow says his son would normally drive to the court, but that Friday evening, he didn't.

""When I saw my car, I checked, [and] Mohamed wasn't at home,"" he said. ""I called him and said, 'Mohamed, you didn't take the car. Are you OK?' He said, 'Yes, dad … I'm here with friends. I'm not far. I just walked.' I said, 'OK.'""

Around 11:45 p.m. ET, Mohamed's friends knocked on his parents' door, distraught, and informed them he'd been shot and taken to the hospital.

""I asked them, 'Is he OK? Is he alive?'"" Sow said. ""They started crying and said, 'We don't know.'""

In a state of shock, Sow rushed to the hospital, where Mohamed succumbed to his injuries the following night.

Condolences for King Mo

After graduating from Runnymede Collegiate Institute in 2017, Mohamed was unsure of which career path to pursue. He began an international relations program at York University but didn't like it and left, saying he needed more time to figure out his future.

Lately, his plans were to take business courses online, Sow said.

""He just wanted to work for himself. That was his dream,"" he said. ""He was thinking [about] what kind of skills he needed or studies he was supposed to do to start his own business.""

About four years ago, he started rapping under the name King Mo and recording songs and videos with the local hip hop crew Came From Nothing.

His latest video premiered in March on the Toronto platform 6ixBuzz. Following his death, messages of condolence were posted across his social media channels.

""Let your music live through the people.... You really were a smart, talented and funny young fly guy,"" wrote pretty_slimmaz.in.da_6ix on his Instagram page.

Aurélie Divine, 22, said Mohamed had already caught the hip hop bug when they were at École Secondaire Toronto Ouest, a French-language high school.

""I'm very happy he was able to go in that route and do something he loved to do,"" she said.

She said she enjoyed spending time with Mohamed after school. The pair bonded over their love of food, often hanging out at Chito's Pizza near Lansdowne subway station or McDonald's.

She recalled one time in winter when she forgot her jacket at school, Mohamed gave her his.

""He said, 'Here, you don't need to give it back. It belongs to you now,'"" said Divine.

Neighbourhood mentor

In his neighbourhood, Mohamed was also known as someone who looked out for others.

He took care of kids he barely knew and gave them money to buy freezies, one friend recalled.

""Mo made sure I was going to school,"" said another friend who grew up with Mohamed but did not want to be named.

""Mo wanted what was best for me. He was there to support me and make sure I made the right decision. He was more like a mentor [and] a brother.""

Alilo Bonghanya, 20, who met Mohamed through a mutual friend in Grade 7, said the news of his death was painful.

""I couldn't believe that this actually happened,"" she said. ""When I saw the news, I immediately started crying.""

Bonghanya said Mohamed was a good and caring friend to her through school and that the highlight of her day was talking to him on the phone.

""In middle and high school, you go through so much, and he was my first male best friend,"" she said. ""Throughout everything, no matter what happened … he just always had my back.""

Mohamed played soccer and basketball in middle school and was skilled on the court, his friend Tracy Mandiangu, 21, said.

""He knew he was good,"" she said. ""He was also very competitive. I remember I was doing stats for a game they were playing … He would ask for his stats just to tease me.""

An only child who wanted to help parents

With no siblings to lean on, Mohamed felt a responsibility to take care of his parents and give back, friends said.

""He was really big on respecting his parents and honouring them as well,"" Divine said.

""He kept saying, 'I'm an only child, and I have to do what's best for my parents.'""

When he travelled to Guinea with them as a young boy, he got a sense of the hardships they overcame. Bah said it helped him understand why she regularly sent money to relatives back home.

He had been working at Pearson International Airport and was eager to financially support his parents as they got older, she said.

""His dream was to give me money before I die,"" Bah said. ""Even his [CERB] money he would give me. I would say, 'But I have money. I don't need it.' He would transfer anything he gets into my account to have.""

Bah said she and her son loved travelling together and planned to go to Saudi Arabia some time this year.

'You're destroying a whole family'

Gun violence continues to plague Toronto. According to recent statistics released by the Toronto Police Service, 24 people have been killed and 87 injured so far this year, and there have been 244 instances of a gun being fired. The night Mohamed was shot, another Toronto hip hop artist, Gleesh, was shot on the other side of town at Scarborough Town Centre. He died of his injuries two days later.

Ousmane Barry, 23, a long-time family friend of the Sows, said those resorting to gun violence don't stop to consider the wider impact.

""People should also think about the pain parents go through when one of their children is killed,"" Barry said. ""You're not just killing one individual; you're destroying a whole family….

""What issue can be so big that the only solution is gun violence?""

25588,2020-07-26 4:00,Federally appointed judges' expenses to be made public for first time,"The expenses of federally appointed judges will be made public this week for the first time — the result of recently implemented changes to the Access to Information Act.

The Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs is expected to publish the numbers on Tuesday, which will include travel, meal, conference and office equipment costs, among other expenses.

The Liberal government pushed the proactive disclosure rules as part of measures to improve transparency and accountability under Bill C-58, An Act to amend the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act, which became law in 2019.

The move is meant to enhance transparency and accountability in the judicial system — but it has faced resistance from federal judges.

The Canadian Superior Courts Judges Association, the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) and the Canadian Bar Association (CBA) have argued the bill jeopardizes judges' personal safety and judicial independence. The organizations insist there are already internal accountability controls to approve and review spending.

""A delicately balanced system designed to reconcile judicial independence with accountability for the expenditure of public funds is already in place. Bill C-58 will disrupt that system,"" says a CBA brief.

The released information will not include the names of individual judges, but will include the number of judges who have had certain expenses reimbursed.

The legislation requires all federally appointed judges to proactively disclose their expenses every three months.

Travel expenses are expected to be lower than usual in Tuesday's publication because of the pandemic. Expenses for technology could be higher, reflecting the fact that more judges have been working from home.

A weaker case for transparency?

Wayne MacKay, professor emeritus at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, calls the upcoming publication of judicial expenses a positive step but said the case for making judges' incidental expenses public is not as strong as it is for senators, MPs or provincial MLAs.

Wayne MacKay, professor emeritus at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, says judges can't publicly defend themselves from criticism of their spending. (Nick Pearce)

""The courts are clearly regarded as a separate kind of institution,"" MacKay said.

""They are a non-political branch of government and, in that sense, the case for absolute transparency on these things isn't as compelling.""

Unlike politicians and other public officials, MacKay said, judges also aren't able to publicly defend or explain themselves.

""That's something else that maybe needs to be addressed,"" he said.

""How can we deal with questions that may have legitimate answers if they had some opportunity through some vehicle to respond to that?""

Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, said it's an anomaly that the expenses of judges have not been made public up to this point.

Wudrick said the disclosure just brings judges in line with the rules for other people paid with public money.

""It's reasonable for taxpayers to know how their money is being spent,"" Wudrick said.

""That's the reason we push for disclosure, for example, for members of Parliament and senators, and I think judges would fall under the same standard.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stefanovich-judicial-expenses-disclosure-1.5662316?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25589,2020-07-26 4:00,"COVID-19 poses big challenges for day camps, programs catering to those with special needs","Parents across the country are trying to fill the empty days this summer for their kids, after many camps and programs were cancelled due to the pandemic. The scramble for playdates, day trips and other activities is a daily preoccupation, but for those with children who are among society's most vulnerable, the need for daily structure is even more crucial.

""Our parents were at their breaking points,"" says Yaffi Scheinberg, executive director of Kayla's Children Centre (KCC) which operates a day camp in Thornhill, Ont., for children with special needs.

Kathy Laszlo, co-founder and director of Developing and Nurturing Independence (DANI), says it was a similar situation for the families of the adults in its programs, many of whom have been without access to support during the pandemic lockdown. ""When there is no respite, there is no health worker coming to your house, there is no one taking out your kid. So you've had to do this 24/7 in the last 18 weeks, and it was a great toll on the families.""

KCC and DANI are the only special needs programs of their kind that have reopened in Ontario so far during the COVID-19 pandemic.

KCC runs a school and a variety of programs for children with disabilities and complex medical issues. The organizers were debating whether or not to open this year, due to the risks posed by COVID-19 and the complexity of making sure the campers would be safe. However, they really wanted to support parents of high-needs kids who were looking at a summer without the break the camp provides them with.

""We feel like we're literally saving lives by having this camp open and giving these kids this opportunity, and giving their parents the chance to recuperate from the trauma that they went through in the last couple of months,"" Scheinberg says.

The programs at Kayla’s Children Centre give campers and their families a break from the stresses of months of COVID-19 isolation, says executive director Yaffi Scheinberg. (Perlita Stroh/CBC)

Julie Higgins is one of those parents. Her six-year-old daughter Emily has attended the camp for three years. Emily suffers from Rett Syndrome, a neurological disorder that robs her of control over her body. She also experiences strong, painful muscle spasms.

After being isolated at home for four months with her daughter, Higgins admits the toll the situation was taking on the family was severe.

""It was awful,"" says Higgins. ""We were in crisis and desperate for anything, it was quite a few months of just survival and just day by day, hour by hour.""

When Higgins heard KCC camp was opening, she decided Emily needed the respite as much as the rest of her family.

""We knew they would take every precaution to make sure it was safe. And obviously you know you're taking a bit of a risk, but we also took into consideration what it was doing to Emily not being around other people, and that was really hard on her.""

Julie Higgins, left, says that at the KCC camp her daughter Emily gets the structure and therapy she needs to thrive. (Perlita Stroh/CBC)

Also hard on Emily was the loss of skills she was experiencing due to the interruption in her therapies. At KCC she receives physiotherapy and occupational therapy, as well as taking part in recreational activities. All that structure is what Higgins says makes her thrive.

""Even though we tried to do as much as we could at home, it's not the same. So, she's getting all that now. She loves it. We can see her strength is back.""

KCC has more than 80 campers this summer and runs the full months of July and August.

Emily's favourite activities at camp include music class and water play. Higgins, who drives her an hour each way to get to and from the camp each day, says her daughter's overall mood has improved dramatically since she's been there.

""She's happy, so we're happy.""

Julie Higgins says until the KCC camp was able to open, the stress of isolation during the pandemic was taking a toll on her daughter Emily and the rest of the family. 'We were in crisis and desperate for anything.' (Perlita Stroh/CBC)

Delicate decisions

Opening the camp during a pandemic was not easy. KCC consulted with public health officials as well as Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children when considering how it could open.

The organizers are using a large building where they can space children out, and they're keeping campers in cohorts of five that do not mix. They take everyone's temperatures at the door, and ensure all counselors and staff wear masks.

They started planning for the possibility of opening in March and remained in constant touch with parents about their intentions.

Scheinberg knew the decision parents were weighing about sending their kids was a delicate one. Many of the children have underlying health conditions that make them high-risk if they contract COVID-19. But on the first day of camp she knew her staff had made the right decision.

""Lots of our parents dropped off their kids that first week and sat in their cars and sobbed. They had a flood of emotion as everything they'd gone through over the past four months just hit them,"" says Scheinberg.

""That was really emotional for us, as a staff, to witness.""

Recreational therapies for adults

Special needs children and their families aren't the only ones who've suffered as a result of the isolation COVID-19 created. Adults with developmental and physical disabilities were also left without the structure of their day programs and specialized therapies.

DANI, also based in Thornhill, has provided these adults with recreational therapies, vocational training and a day program since 2006. When it closed in March due to the pandemic, many of its families were left without care.

Even though DANI did transition to online programming, not all of its clients could participate. That didn't sit well with Kathy Laszlo, who co-founded the centre after her own special-needs son aged out of programs for children with disabilities.

""I personally feel that even if one person is left behind because they cannot be part of this online learning, it's one too many,"" says Laszlo.

""We always want to put the participants first. We knew it was going to be a major undertaking, but it's their need and the families' need.""

Kathy Laszlo says reopening the DANI camp and making sure everyone would be safe was a huge undertaking, but it was well worth the effort. (Perlita Stroh/CBC)

Laszlo was right, reopening DANI was a huge undertaking. The centre fundraised and spent upwards of $25,000 installing plexiglass barriers, investing in personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitation stations, and hiring a consultant to help them meet government protocols.

Even then, it could only offer its participants two half-days per week to ensure proper social distancing. They are currently able to accommodate most of their 34 regular program participants, and plan to continue doing so as long as restrictions allow.

Laszlo says even this reduced program was worth the effort.

""The parents are overjoyed, they are so grateful. Anything we can do, even three hours twice a week, we see them when they drop off the participants and they can't thank us enough.""

Gary and Rina Kogon's daughter Tanya, 42, is one of those able to attend the DANI program. She suffers from cerebral palsy, a global development delay and a seizure disorder. The past four months at home were not easy for her, or her parents.

""She requires 24/7 care, someone nearby,"" says Gary. ""Unrelenting is a good word, because we don't have that break ... but like everything else with these special needs, you don't have a choice, you just do it.""

Gary and Rina Kogon's daughter Tanya requires 24/7 care. Gary says she was excited about the camp reopening, and 'when she's happy, we're satisfied.' (Perlita Stroh/CBC)

Rina adds that knowing her daughter is in good hands and receiving much-needed stimulation helped her make the decision to send Tanya back to DANI, even with the risk posed by COVID-19.

""When we saw how they were doing it, I felt relieved,"" says Rina. ""And, she was looking forward to it, she was so excited.""

""When she's happy we're satisfied,"" adds Gary.

DANI hopes to ramp up its program to full time as remaining COVID-19 restrictions are loosened. The group is also looking for more space so they can bring back more participants, and applying for government grants to expand their online learning program for clients who can't yet return physically.

Lazlo says her knowledge of what her own son needs drives her to keep going and helping others.

""People with disabilities need a good schedule,"" she says. ""Most of them don't chit-chat on the phone, they don't do Facebook and all those typical things a 20-something would do. They need a personal touch, to be together, to be heard, to talk or be listened to. Or even just to be there.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/special-needs-camps-programs-covid-19-1.5656283?cmp=rss,news,health,
25590,2020-07-26 4:00,South of France sees fortunes decline as COVID-19 keeps many wealthy foreign tourists away,"Summer in the south of France. The sun is shining, the cicadas are sawing their song of love, men and women are bent over in the fields picking fruit and preparing vines, middle-aged cyclists in gaudy spandex costumes covering lumpy bodies labour up and down hills and dream of the Tour de France, the world's most famous and gruelling professional bicycle race.

But there was no Tour de France this July. It might take place starting at the end of August.

Instead, on July 20, the day after the Tour was supposed to finish, the French were ordered to wear masks in shops and offices and in any indoor public space. Someone caught by police not wearing a mask will be fined the equivalent of $200 Cdn.

COVID-19 has comparatively lightly brushed the départements of the south. While Paris remained a government-declared ""red"" zone until the beginning of June, the south had been ""green"" for weeks. It still is, despite a slight rise in cases.

There have been just over 30,000 COVID-19 deaths in France. In the southern Provence Côte d'Azur region, with five million residents, there have been just under 1,500 — and just 12 deaths in July.

But the economic impact of the novel coronavirus has been devastating.

For weeks the region's beaches, towns and cafés were eerily quiet. The virus has exposed its vulnerability when tourism dries up.

Last year, the Côte d'Azur region boasted of receiving 20 million tourists, half of them foreigners. This winter and spring, the visitors disappeared, hotels were shuttered, beaches were empty and the Cannes Film festival was cancelled along with the Monaco Formula 1 race.

That amounted to a loss of $1.95 billion to the region, according to Claire Behar, director of the Côte d'Azur tourism committee.

""We've had tough moments in the past,"" said Rudy Salles, the deputy mayor of Nice, including a terror attack by a man driving a truck into a Bastille Day crowd on July 14, 2016 that killed 86 people.

""The difference now is the lack of visibility in which to launch a tourism comeback plan.

Foreign workers vulnerable to virus

While officials worry about lost tourists and lost revenue, work goes on in the fruit fields. But the virus has also exposed the potentially illegal exploitation of foreign workers — many from South America — brought to France each year to pick fruit and tend wine-producing vines.

Their situation became front-page local news when a cluster of 258 workers living in a camp near the city of Arles tested positive for COVID-19 in June. None died, but all were quarantined without work for weeks.

(Sebastien Salom-Gomis/AFP via Getty Images)

Then it turned out that French magistrates were investigating the Spanish company, Terra Fecundis, that hired them and brought them to France. It faces charges of fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable workforce.

This is big business. There are several such companies, but Terra Fecundis is the biggest. It had annual revenue of $90 million in 2018 and more than 6,700 workers. It buses them — many from Equador, El Salvador and Colombia, but all living in Spain with immigrant status — to France to work for more than 50 agricultural concerns. Most workers speak no French.

In the village down the road from our house, a bus from another company pulls up at noon each day, and half a dozen exhausted and sweaty Equadoran workers climb out. They will be picked up later from rented rooms to work the afternoon shift in the fields.

The European Union's technical term for them is ""posted workers."" The EU allows men and women from poorer countries such as Bulgaria to Spain to be posted temporarily in richer countries like France, which need cheap labour.

According to a thick file drawn up by French police and prosecutors in Marseille, Terra Fecundis has systematically abused the system for years. Although it is based in Spain, 99 per cent of its revenue comes from France.

Because employer medicare, pension and unemployment contributions are lower in Spain than in France, it makes money on the state minimum wage (approximately $15 an hour) it collects in France for each worker. The pay is low but more than the South Americans would get in Spain.

Company that hires workers faces charges

Prosecutors allege the company has also cheated its workers out of some of their wages, not paid overtime hours and falsified worksheets to further cheat them.

Terra Fecundis also houses its workers. Conditions in some of these camps are said to be atrocious. One was baptized by its inmates ""el Carcel — the prison.""

""I was treated like a dog,"" one Equadoran worker there told the police. ""We had no blanket, no mattress. We had to sleep on the floor in the dining area.""

El Carcel was closed by French police at the end of 2017, but the abusive conditions continued. One investigator described conditions for the workers as ""equivalent to human trafficking.""

The company has been charged with massive fraud — more than $150 million over several years — and brutal exploitation of its workforce. The trial was scheduled for May, but COVID-19 shut down the courts. It may take place in the fall.

What is notable is that none of the French agricultural operations where the South Americans work have ever voiced public concern about their conditions. It is akin to a conspiracy of silence.

So work in the fields goes on while the trial awaits.

Full beaches raise COVID-19 concerns

And the beaches of the Mediterranean are filling up. Those frolicking in the waves are almost all French, released from confinement but reluctant to go abroad.

There are so many already that the French authorities, seeing the incidence of COVID-19 beginning to rise again slowly across the country, worry about the lack of physical distancing.

Beaches in the south of France are filling up again, like this one earlier this month, raising concerns among health officials about the lack of physical distancing. Cases of COVID-19 are beginning to slowly rise again across the country. (Eric Gaillard/Reuters)

""This is the unbearable lightness of the crowd,"" one angry doctor on the coast sniffed anonymously to the newspaper Le Monde.

Hotels bewail the fact that the French are much more frugal than foreign visitors. They spend half of what Germans do and less than a third of the real big spenders — Russians, Americans and people from the Middle East.

None of those big spenders will be seen this summer.

So luxury hotels like Hôtel Belles Rives in Antibes are scrambling.

""We must try to come up with new ways of doing things,"" director Stéphane Vuillaume told the public television channel France 3. ""We've got to start selling takeout meals to clients.""

And also do the unthinkable: lower room prices.

Tourism accounts for 13 per cent of the region's economy. Much of that will be lost this year. Cafés will close for good. More than 15 per cent of cafés in the country will die, according to the French association of cafés and restaurants.

And fear will keep people away.

""We get calls all the time with questions like: 'Can you guarantee that this hotel or that campsite follows all the virus rules?'"" Jerome Arnaud, a tourism office director in the south, said.

""We tell them our professionals are good, but we can't guarantee everything. This year is basically impossible.""

The cicadas are still singing. The humans in the tourism industry are not.

In the south of France, this will be known as the lost year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-france-covid-19-tourism-workers-1.5662305?cmp=rss,news,world,
25591,2020-07-26 4:00,Jets' Blake Wheeler steps away from domestic chaos to play in Stanley Cup qualifiers,"Like many parents, Blake Wheeler and his wife Sam stickhandled homeschooling, cooking, and cleaning — not to mention refereeing disputes between their three kids —through the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, the Winnipeg Jets captain is about to step away from the domestic chaos to skate in the National Hockey League Stanley Cup qualifiers in Edmonton.

""We were in south Florida, in the epicentre of everything going on right now,"" Wheeler told reporters via Zoom on the opening day of training camp. ""It's definitely been a nerve-wracking and anxious few months. ""When you think about everything going on in the world – and then you think about going back and playing a game – it's sometimes hard to put that in perspective.""

Wheeler and the Jets practice in Winnipeg one last time Sunday morning and then embark for the Alberta capital for an undetermined time period. The longer they stay, the deeper their run in the chase for a title. All the uncertainty makes it hard for Wheeler to say goodbye to Sam and the kids.

""It's been very challenging,"" he said. ""So the thought of leaving all that on Sam's plate is probably something I haven't come to terms with yet.""

If it's any consolation, Wheeler and the Jets won't have much spare time to ruminate. First, they clash with the Vancouver Canucks on Wednesday night in their first and only exhibition game. Then they open the qualifying round next Saturday in the first of a best-of-five against the Calgary Flames.

In part 5 of 10, Rob Pizzo breaks down the only all-Canadian matchup in the qualification round. 1:11

""The entire time during the pause, after one day I was ready to play hockey again,"" said Jets centre Mark Scheifele, who amassed 29 goals and 73 points in 71 games this season. ""There was obviously a lot to deal with, but now that we're back to hockey, that's the excitement — playing the game we love every single day.

""No matter what it is, we're playing hockey and we get to compete for the Stanley Cup. That's the ultimate dream.""

The Jets (37-28-6) enter the qualifiers as a team that spent most of the 2019/20 campaign on the playoff bubble. But look closely, and there's reason for optimism among the local fanbase.

Built for the post-season

In many ways, the Jets are built for the post-season with their size and speed up front. They have a Vezina Trophy finalist in goalie Connor Hellebuyck. And their core players have valuable playoff experience.

""You don't have to explain to your players what playoffs look like,"" Jets coach Paul Maurice said. ""Which, you go back two years, we had to. We didn't really have the guys that have ever played a playoff game, let alone had a long run. ""But now we have consecutive years where our drivers are familiar with how the playoffs work.""

'Everything on the line'

It's the adrenaline,"" he said. ""When you get into a tight game and it's the third period, it's the guys that are calm, cool, and collected, but they have that adrenaline buried deep inside them that is ready to come out. ""That's what I'm looking forward to. A real-game situation with everything on the line and that adrenaline starts pumping. That's what I'm craving the most.""

At age 33, Wheeler realizes his chances of hoisting the Stanley Cup are likely numbered. With that in the mind, he's following his wife's advice as he prepares for takeoff to Edmonton.

""When we've talked about it, basically what we came down to is she says, 'Don't just leave and play just three games. That would be a waste of time. At least give me something to entertain me,"" he said. ""So, that's kind of where we've left it for now. ""Hopefully we can go on a little bit of a run and give everyone back home something to cheer about.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/winnipeg-jets-1.5663367?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
25616,2020-07-26 1:20,This stolen teddy bear has a recording of a dying mother's last message. Her daughter wants it back,"Mara Soriano doesn't care if she gets her iPad or her Nintendo Switch back. She just wants to recover a precious recording of her mother's voice.

Soriano, 28, said her mother's voice was recorded and put in a custom-made Build-a-Bear teddy bear, which was stolen from her Friday. The audio recording is a final message from her mother, Marilyn Soriano, who died of cancer in June 2019 at age 53.

The bear's disappearance came as Soriano was distracted while moving into a new apartment in Vancouver's West End on Friday.

While she and her fiancé were unloading their U-Haul van, she got a call from a friend who was biking over to help them who said they had been hit by a work van a short distance away.

Mara Soriano is desperately seeking this teddy bear stolen in Vancouver's West End. It has a final message from her mother, Marilyn, who died of cancer in 2019.

Soriano immediately put down the bag she was carrying up to the apartment and leaned it against the van. She drove over to her friend in a different vehicle to bring him to his home.

But in her ""frazzled state,"" she said she forgot to tell her fiancé where the bag was. After being unattended for just a few minutes, she said, it went missing. She says someone stole the bag.

""It just makes me feel devastated,"" Soriano said. ""I'm absolutely crushed.""

Soriano said her mother recorded a message for her and had the audio put it in the bear shortly before going into hospice.

""At hospice her voice was different. Much softer. Not the mom I grew up with,"" she said. ""That bear is the last memory I have of her speaking in her normal voice.

""She said that she loved me and she was proud of me and that she'll always be with me.""

Also in the bag, Soriano said, were important documents — a book of blank cheques, her citizenship card, her and her fiance's passports and social insurance cards — and valuable electronics — an iPad and a Nintendo Switch.

But she said she doesn't care about getting those items back. She just wants her bear.

'It's a reminder of home'

Soriano said after looking through all their boxes and calling U-Haul to see if it was left in the van, she asked her building concierge to check the security footage.

""Lo and behold on the security footage, this guy was seen looking around, making sure nobody was looking first,"" she described. ""And he just took the bag and ran.""

She said the concierge wouldn't let her have the footage or take photos of the screen without the building manager's permission and the manager won't be able to do that until Monday.

Soriano said she has filed a police report and is asking anyone who has it or sees it to bring it back.

It's a message that is being amplified by some powerful voices on social media, including Vancouver-born Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds who offered a $5,000 reward on Twitter for the bear's return.

Vancouver: $5,000 to anyone who returns this bear to Mara. Zero questions asked. I think we all need this bear to come home. <a href=""https://t.co/L4teoxoY50"">https://t.co/L4teoxoY50</a> —@VancityReynolds

""It was just absolutely crushing to me that that was the one thing that was stolen from us,"" Soriano said.

Along with having the voice of her mother in it, Soriano said the bear is a reminder of home and helps her feel connected to her family.

She was born in the Philippines and moved to Toronto when she was nine. She moved to Vancouver five years ago.

Ronson was back in the UFC octagon Saturday six years after his last bout for the organization, and claimed a first-round submission victory against Denmark's Nicolas (Lokomotivo) Dalby on a UFC Fight Night undercard on Fight Island.

After dropping his opponent to the mat with a strong left punch, Ronson (22-10-0) submitted Dalby (18-4-1) with a rear-naked choke just 2:48 into the fight.

""I was so nervous for this because it's a life-long goal to get back here, took so long to get back here, and I was so nervous,"" said Ronson.

""It feels so good, I've waited seven years for this. I feel that, where my skills are at right now, I'm only going to get better and I've got to make the most of my time.""

The 34-year-old from London, Ont., who moved up a weight class to take on Dalby, was stepping in for the injured Danny (Hot Chocolate) Roberts.

Ronson lost three straight in the UFC in 2013-14 and was 8-5 since leaving the organization while balancing training and delivering cleaning supplies as a day job.

""I could have done better and next time I will,"" said Ronson. ""When I get back to 155, my real weight class, you're going to see, there's going to be no hesitation because I'm not afraid of anyone's punches or power or strength or anything like that.""

The UFC reached out to Ronson on 11 days notice for the UFC 231 in December 2018. He accepted, but couldn't make weight and the UFC moved on.

The main event at Yas Island features middleweight contenders Robert (The Reaper) Whittaker and Darren (The Gorilla) Till.

Alberta's Tanner Boser claims another knockout victory

Meanwhile, Canadian heavyweight Tanner (The Bulldozer) Boser beat Brazil's Raphael (Bebezao) Pessoa by second-round knockout on the undercard.

Boser (19-6-1) clipped Pessoa (10-2) with a strong left hook that sent the Brazilian into the cage before falling to the mat, where the Canadian continued to punch until it was over.

""I felt my hand go into his eye, so I don't know if there's damage in his orbital bone or something, but it was a solid shot, I felt it on my knuckles,"" said Boser.

Hines-Allen, who came into the game with seven career 3-pointers made, hit 3 of 4 from behind the arc.

The Mystics are missing reigning MVP Elena Delle Donne, who is rehabbing a back injury, and newly acquired centre Tina Charles, who was medically excused for the season. Washington is also without Natasha Cloud, who is focusing on social justice causes this season, and LaToya Sanders.

25575,2020-07-25 19:44,"Werenski takes advantage of Thompson's late stumble, tied for lead at 3M Open","Michael Thompson hasn't experienced the anxiety and thrill of playing the last round of a tournament in the final group for several years.

This time, pitted against Richy Werenski in the 3M Open, he'll do so without the murmuring, clapping and roaring sounds from the spectators. For Thompson, that'll do just fine.

""It kind of allows me to keep my emotions even keel. That's kind of the way I play golf. That's what I like to do on the golf course,"" Thompson said. ""I don't talk very much, and sometimes if I get too riled up or faced with a hard shot in front of a lot of people, I get a little nervous. I'm not going to lie about that. It's just who I am. I think no fans, it's going to allow me to be more composed.""

Werenski birdied three of the last four holes Saturday to erase a four-stroke deficit and catch Thompson for the lead. After sharing the halfway lead, Thompson and Werenski travelled vastly different paths to each shoot 3-under 68. They walked together to the clubhouse even again, tied at 15 under at the TPC Twin Cities.

""There's still a lot of golf left. I just kind of want to keep hanging around, and hopefully something happens,"" Werenski said.

Charl Schwartzel shot a 66 in the third round, pulling even with Tony Finau for third place at 13 under. Max Homa posted a 64, making a big jump to fifth at 12 under.

Thompson, who entered the week well below the cut for the FedEx Cup Playoffs in 151st place, made three straight birdies on the front nine of his 228th career start. The 35-year-old, whose only tour win was at the Honda Classic in Florida in 2013, knocked in another one on the 590-yard, par-5 12th hole to move to 16 under.

Thompson held a four-stroke lead until the 15th, when his game on the greens suddenly faltered. His 8-foot putt for birdie went long, and he settled for par.

Werenski, who was one spot off the FedEx Cup cut last season and came to Minnesota in 89th place, birdied the 15th hole to move up. So did their playing partner Finau, making up for three earlier bogeys.

Thompson rolled a 15-footer too long on the 17th green, too, taking just his second bogey of the entire tournament as a light rain began to fall on another muggy and breezy afternoon in this suburb north of Minneapolis as the heat index reached the upper 90s.

Thompson, whose best finish on this virus-interrupted tour schedule was a tie for eighth at the RBC Heritage in South Carolina, started 18th with even more trouble by hitting his drive into the drink. There were 248 balls hit into water hazards over Thursday and Friday, the most through two rounds on the PGA Tour this season.

Thompson's next try after the penalty stroke landed in the greenside bunker, but he saved par with a clutch chip out of the sand that landed 7 feet from the cup. He pumped his arm and gave his caddie a quick fist bump, the only display of emotion on the quiet green.

Handful within striking distance

Werenski, whose 63 in the first round is tied for the low score of the tournament, birdied that hole. That set up their Sunday duel with a handful of competitors well within striking distance.

That includes Schwartzel, the 35-year-old South African who has two career tour victories. He just missed an eagle on the 18th, when his 70-foot shot from the bunker almost dropped in.

""It was a slow motion lip-out,"" said Schwartzel, who is the only player to make birdie or better on every par-5 hole this week, the first time in his tour career he's done so.

Homa, who missed the cut on four of his last five starts, had eight birdies.

""I guess it's been, I don't know, four or so months since I've been in any kind of heat other than the cut heat, so it was kind of nice to just keep doing what I was doing at the beginning of the season,"" said Homa, who bogeyed the 17th.

Tringale made four birdies and an eagle over his first eight holes on the way to tying his career low score with a 63, last posted in 2011. He only needed 25 putts, giving himself an outside chance for his first tour win.

""Golf's a game of confidence. I love where I'm at. I love where my game's at,"" Tringale said. ""Sundays are a different day, so I'm excited about the opportunity.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/3m-open-saturday-recap-1.5663435?cmp=rss,sports,golf,

25574,2020-07-25 19:11,'Expect the unexpected': Maple Leafs eager to see what NHL bubble life has in store,"John Tavares had yet to finish packing. Tyson Barrie never bothered to empty his suitcase after arriving back in town to begin preparations for an NHL restart that was far from certain.

Like the league's other 23 teams set to embark on a sprint that could see the Stanley Cup awarded in early October — more than 365 days after the pandemic-delayed 2019-20 season began — the Toronto Maple Leafs are eager to head into the great unknown of bubble life.

""I've got a few things done,"" Tavares, the club's captain, said when asked if his bags were ready following Saturday's final training camp practice. ""It's not something you've ever been through, so it takes a little bit of time to think about it.

""You're just going to have to wing it a little bit.""

That's a good way of describing what a lot of the next two months could look like in the hub cities of Toronto and Edmonton.

Normal game-day and practice routines are out the window. Enter an era of strange start times and life behind fences in secure zones as the NHL aims to keep COVID-19 from ruining its plan to finish a campaign suspended in mid-March.

""Expect the unexpected and be comfortable being uncomfortable,"" Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said of his consistent message to the team. ""We have to take things as they come, not complain, keep our head down, continue to work, and be as prepared as possible, as focused as possible, for the challenge ahead.

""Everything else is out of our control.""

Barrie, who arrived in Toronto from his home in Victoria back in June to begin skating with teammates in voluntary workouts, said there's a growing feeling of anticipation.

""There is a sense of adventure to it,"" said the defenceman. ""Excitement, a bit of nerves, but we've been here a while and we're ready to get it going.

""Now it starts for real.""

Teams arrive Sunday

All teams are scheduled to arrive in the hubs on Sunday — the Eastern Conference will be based in Toronto, while the West will set up shop in Edmonton — before playing one exhibition contest next week.

""There's been a lot of talk about what life's gonna be like in the bubble and, and what's gonna be available,"" Leafs winger Zach Hyman said. ""It's a long time coming and we didn't know if it was gonna happen or not.""

Toronto will face off against the Montreal Canadiens at Scotiabank Arena on Tuesday night, its one tune-up before starting a five-game qualifying round matchup Aug. 2 against the Columbus Blue Jackets for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs.

As Toronto and Edmonton prepare to host the rest of the NHL season, questions are being raised about player safety and the accuracy of the financial benefits for the bubble cities. 2:01

""You treat it like a real game because that's the only way you can get prepared,"" Hyman added of the meeting with Montreal. ""All these exhibition games are going to be pretty intense and pretty up-tempo. I don't think anybody's going to be holding back.""

The dry run will also be important for a host of other reasons, including getting acclimatized to playing in empty arenas, different benches and locker rooms, and all the health protocols inside venues that will host as many as three games per day.

""You'll get some feel for it,"" Tavares said of establishing a semblance of a routine. ""But at the same time, I think things are going to be changing, evolving as we go. You're going to just have to continue to adapt.

""If there's certain games that go into overtime and pushes start times later, that's nothing you've ever dealt with before. There's a possibility for a lot of different things. You just have to be very open-minded, have to be able to adjust on the fly and deal with the circumstances.""

Smallest details

Keefe said teams will have to be aware of even the smallest details, from how many people are allowed in an elevator at one time, to getting to and from practice without running into another team heading in the opposite direction.

""We've tried to remain very flexible,"" he said. ""We have a general plan of what we want to do with timelines and all that, but all the way through this, particularly this first week, we're going to be making a lot of adjustments along the way as we learn more about what's possible.""

Tavares said the Leafs and every other NHLer involved in the restart should be thankful for this opportunity in a world — both inside and outside hockey's bubbles — that remains incredibly uncertain.

""We know what a lot of people are going through, what the world is going through,"" he said. ""To be able to do this again, have a chance to complete this season, continue to compete and chase the Stanley Cup, there's nothing better.

""Just look at the big picture and realize we're pretty fortunate.""

When officers arrived, the BEI said in a statement, one of the two men in the alleged altercation ran away.

One of the officers caught up with the man and pepper-sprayed him. Once ""subdued,"" the man lost consciousness, the statement reads.

The man was taken to hospital, where he died a few hours later.

Eight BEI investigators are in charge of the probe. The watchdog is also seeking assistance from Quebec provincial police, which will provide a forensics specialist to help out.

Ji-Man Choi drove in Tampa Bay's other run with a sixth-inning double off Matt Shoemaker, who made his first start for the Blue Jays since injuring his left knee in April 2019.

The portrait depicts Elizabeth wearing a blue knee-length dress, pearls and low-heeled black shoes, seated on a chair covered in gold leaf in an ornately furnished room, with a tea cup and a vase of mauve roses on the table beside her.

On the wall behind the Queen is the bottom of a much older portrait, of which only a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the lower part of a lady's white frilly dress is visible.

The painting was commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a 'lasting tribute' to the Queen's service to diplomacy. (Foreign and Commonwealth Office via The Associated Press)

""I'm glad I've had the chance to see it. I hope I'll see it in real life one day,"" Queen Elizabeth said after watching the portrait be unveiled via video conference.

The Queen saw the painting on her computer screen and observed that a tea cup in the portrait lacked a key ingredient: tea. Escofet told the monarch that she had included the insignia of the FCO on the cup.

""She seemed to react very positively to it,"" Escofet said. ""She was smiling, asking how long it took and if I had any more projects on the go after this.""

The 94-year-old monarch also thanked foreign ministry staff for their efforts to repatriate British nationals who struggled to return home due to coronavirus restrictions, and also heard about international efforts to develop a vaccine.

""There was no better sound than the sound of people's awes when it dropped. It's bigger than life, it's very prominent — as he was,"" said Juanita Peters, executive director of the museum.

Dixon was born in the community — now a park — on July 29, 1870. He would have turned 150 this month.

After leaving for Boston as a teenager to launch his fight career, he eventually held titles at bantamweight, featherweight and paperweight.

The mural was painted on the sides of a shipping container used for storage and it can be seen from all directions.

The City of Halifax demolished Africville in the 1960s, but a few homes were relocated. Ada Adams has one of them. She hopes the George Dixon mural will become a conversation starter.

'It's quite a dangerous walk to get here'

Those who attended the unveiling on foot and on bikes wanted to highlight the need for better public transit and safe pedestrian infrastructure to the park. There are no bus routes that directly go there.

""It's quite a dangerous walk to get here,"" Irvine Carvery, president of the Africville Genealogy Society. ""Most of it is no sidewalks, it's the approach to and from the [MacKay] bridge, so traffic is very, very heavy.""

Carvery lived in Africville until he was 13.

Even back then, he said there were no bus routes to the community. He said heavy truck traffic along Barrington Street also makes the commute on foot and by bike less safe.

The only other way to get to the park is coming off Bayne Street, but Carvery said most people don't know about that route.

25569,2020-07-25 17:10,Chicago goalie Corey Crawford returns after positive COVID-19 test,"Chicago goaltender Corey Crawford practiced Saturday after he missed the start of training camp following a positive COVID-19 test.

The 35-year-old Crawford said he was in quarantine at his place in Chicago.

""The first few days that I started feeling symptoms, that was the hardest,"" Crawford said on a video conference call. ""The last couple weeks, maybe a little bit more, was a little bit easier. But I still couldn't really do much in case there was something wrong with my lungs or my heart, so we had to get that checked out first before I really started pushing in the gym or come on the ice.""

The return of Crawford is a big development for Chicago as it prepares for its qualifying series against Edmonton and its high-scoring duo of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. But he has little time to get up to speed before Game 1 of their best-of-five series on Aug. 1.

""Excited to be back,"" Crawford said. ""Going to try and get into it as quick as possible and try and get that game shape back.""

Crawford missed parts of the previous two seasons because of concussions. But he had been playing well when the league was shut down, recording a .930 save percentage in his last 17 games.

Crawford was in net when Chicago won the Stanley Cup in 2013 and 2015. He is 48-37 with a .919 save percentage and 2.28 goals-against average in 87 career playoff appearances.

""We don't have a lot of time, so we do have some urgency,"" coach Jeremy Colliton said. ""But he knows that and he's been through it before as far as trying to come back off an injury and get right in. So we'll keep going on that process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/chicago-nhl-corey-crawford-returns-covid-19-1.5663329?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
25567,2020-07-25 16:50,"Anthony Alford appreciates Blue Jays' support for BLM, but says 'long way to go'","Before the first pitch of the season, Anthony Alford developed an even closer bond with Toronto Blue Jays teammate Cavan Biggio thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Prior to taking the field at Tampa Bay, Biggio asked Alford if it would make him more comfortable if he would kneel alongside him during the national anthem.

Alford, who is Black, said he was planning to kneel regardless, but appreciated the support from a white teammate.

""Much respect goes to him because it took a lot of courage for him to get down on that knee and show us that 'Hey I'm with you not just as a teammate but as a friend and as a brother,""' Alford, wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt, said during a 25-minute video conference with reporters prior to Saturday's second game of the series against the Rays.

""Me and Cav became real close over the past few years [in the Jays' minor-league system]. It just really meant a lot for him to get down there with me.""

Conversation with Bichette

The outfielder recalled a recent conversation with Blue Jays shortstop Bo Bichette that also clearly meant a lot to Alford.

""Bo went to a majority Black school with a lot of kids from the 'hood. Hopefully he's OK with me sharing this,"" Alford said.

""He was telling me how there's so much potential, so many kids with just God-gifted abilities that go to that school. And 30 minutes up the road is kids that are nowhere close when it comes to skill wise or ability.

""He said the difference is — and I knew this but it was awesome that he acknowledged it — the kids in these Black communities just don't get the opportunities. They have the same skill level if not better but just don't get the same opportunity as these privileged kids.""

While Alford said he has received full support from the Blue Jays, he acknowledges there is plenty of work ahead. Several Blue Jays have worn Black Lives Matter T-shirts and some kneeled for the anthem, but others opted not to do so.

'We still have a long way to go'

""It definitely would have meant a lot to me if everybody wore it, but the reality is we still have a long way to go,"" Alford said. ""People have their beliefs and I respect them as human beings. It's not going to make me feel any different about them as a person. I'm going to still love them, I'm still going to joke with them, laugh with them, and communicate with them. It was disappointing, but at the same time I still respect them.""

Alford regularly goes back to where he grew up in Mississippi to try to convey a message of hope. He says he wants kids to know any life goals are attainable, while stressing it won't be easy.

Alford can relate to the challenges. He recalled, as a 12-year-old, having a police officer draw a gun while searching the car he was in as he returned from a cottage with some friends.

""Things like that happened all the time,"" Alford said. ""It's really not fair, nobody really deserves that. I shouldn't have to feel intimidated or scared or nervous when police come around. You're supposed to protect me. Every time you come around I get nervous.

""Even to this day, if I'm driving and see a police car, the first thing I'm going to do is look and see how fast I'm going because I don't want to have any interaction with a police officer. I just don't want to give them the time of day. It's sad it has to be like that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/toronto-blue-jays-anthony-alford-black-lives-matter-1.5663325?cmp=rss,sports,baseball,mlb
25564,2020-07-25 16:37,Prolific U.S. TV host Regis Philbin dies at 88: Report,"Regis Philbin, a familiar face to TV viewers as an energetic and funny talk and game show host who logged more hours in front of the camera than anyone else in the history of U.S. television, has died at 88, according to a report.

Philbin died Friday, just over a month before his 89th birthday. He died of natural causes, said a family statement to People magazine.

""His family and friends are forever grateful for the time we got to spend with him — for his warmth, his legendary sense of humour and his singular ability to make every day into something worth talking about,"" the statement said. ""We thank his fans and admirers for their incredible support over his 60-year career and ask for privacy as we mourn his loss.""

Philbin was known for his rough edges, funny anecdotes, self-deprecating humour and a Bronx accent that was once described as sounding ""like a racetrack announcer with a head cold."" American comedian and late-night host David Letterman, a longtime friend, called Philbin the funniest man on television.

Philbin — known to fans as ""Reeg"" — was a fixture on various local and national shows for a half century with co-hosts including Kathie Lee Gifford and Kelly Ripa, winning millions of fans as well as honours as the top U.S. talk and game show host.

He hosted the successful Who Wants to be a Millionaire program when it debuted in the United States in 1999 as well as other game shows. Philbin signed a deal in 2000 making his salary for Who Wants to be a Millionaire $20 million a year — the most ever for a game show host.

Philbin's question to contestants, ""Is that your final answer?"" became a national catchphrase. Philbin was even a fashion trendsetter; he put out a line of monochramactic shirts and ties to match what he wore on the set.

In 2011, as Philbin was ending his run as co-host of the popular Live! With Regis and Kelly at age 80, the New York Times wrote : ""In a daytime landscape filled with bland, polished hosts and smarmy good cheer, Mr. Philbin was crumpled, nasal and histrionic. He was a snaggletooth amid cosmetic dentistry and porcelain veneers.""

""Spontaneity is everything to me, working without a net,"" Philbin told the Times in 2011.

Guinness World Records listed him as having put in more time on camera than anyone else in the history of U.S. television, about 17,000 hours.

Philbin first made a name for himself in the 1960s with his own show on local TV in San Diego and then as a sidekick to comedian Joey Bishop on another program.

His biggest success came in the various incarnations of his nationally syndicated morning talk show that began in 1983, when he created The Morning Show for WABC in his native New York City.

After two co-hosts came and went, singer Gifford joined him in a highly successful collaboration in 1985, and in 1988 the program gained national syndication. Gifford remained his co-host for 15 years before Philbin was partnered with perky former soap opera actress Ripa for 11 years. Ripa remained as host of the show after Philbin departed.

""I think he is the world's greatest storyteller,"" Ripa said in 2011. ""That's his gift.""

In 2001, he won a Daytime Emmy as outstanding talk show host and another Emmy for outstanding game show host for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He also received a lifetime achievement Daytime Emmy award in 2008.

Philbin was known for his candid appraisals of his career. He told ABC's 20/20 program in 2001 that he left the Live! talk show in part because the contract offered to him ""wasn't what I expected or I thought I deserved.""

He said his No. 1 career regret was that he had worked so many unheralded years on local programs in Los Angeles and New York before getting national exposure in 1988. ""I wish I didn't have to wait till I was in my late 50s before the good part of my life started in this business,"" he told 20/20.

Philbin wrote books including How I Got This Way, I'm Only One Man! and Who Wants To Be Me? and was also a singer.

Regis Francis Xavier Philbin grew up in the New York borough of the Bronx, the son of Italian-Irish parents and named for the Roman Catholic boys high school his father attended. He went to the University of Notre Dame and was such an enthusiastic alum, he once said he wanted his ashes scattered there.

Philbin then served in the U.S. Navy before beginning his television career.

He dealt with heart problems during his career and underwent triple-bypass surgery in New York in 2007 at age 75.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/regis-philbin-television-dead-1.5663283?cmp=rss,news,entertainment,
25563,2020-07-25 16:05,Civil rights icon John Lewis honoured in Alabama at 1st of several memorial services,"Civil rights icon and longtime U.S. congressman John Lewis was remembered Saturday — in the rural Alabama county where his story began — as a humble man who sprang from his family's farm with a vision that ""good trouble"" could change the world.

The morning service in the city of Troy in rural Pike County was held at Troy University, where Lewis would often playfully remind the chancellor that he was denied admission in 1957 because he was Black and where, decades later, he was awarded an honorary doctorate.

Lewis died July 17 at the age of 80.

Saturday morning's service was titled ""The Boy from Troy,"" the nickname Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave Lewis at their first meeting in 1958 in Montgomery, Ala. King had sent the 18-year-old Lewis a round-trip bus ticket because Lewis was interested in trying to attend the then-all-white university in Troy, just 16 kilometres from his family's farm in Pike County.

It was the first of days of memorials and services.

On Sunday, his flag-draped casket is to be carried across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., where the one-time ""Freedom Rider"" was among civil rights demonstrators beaten by state troopers in 1965. He also was to lie in repose at the state Capitol in Montgomery. After another memorial at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, where he will lie in state, funeral services will be held in Georgia.

'Keep his legacy alive'

At the Troy University service, his brothers and sisters recalled Lewis — who was called Robert at home — as a boy who practised preaching and singing gospel songs to the farm animals, and as a young man who left with a vision to change the world.

""I remember the day that John left home. Mother told him not to get in trouble, not to get in the way ... but we all know that John got in trouble, got in the way, but it was good trouble,"" his brother Samuel Lewis said.

""And the troubles that he got himself into would change the world.""

Lewis's casket was in the university's arena, where attendees were seated spaced apart and masks were required for entry because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The John Lewis I want you to know is the John Lewis who would gravitate to the least of these,"" his brother Henry Grant Lewis said, a biblical reference to Jesus's instructions to aid those in need.

His brother said that on the day Lewis was sworn in to Congress, they exchanged a thumbs up. He later asked Lewis what he was thinking when they did. ""He said, `I was thinking this is a long way from the cotton fields of Alabama,""' Henry Grant Lewis recalled.

Family members implored the crowd to continue Lewis's work. ""He often told us if you see something wrong, do something,"" said his sister, Rosa Tyner.

Lewis's young great-nephew, Jaxon Lewis Brewster, spoke briefly, saying,"" Congressman Lewis was my uncle and my hero, and it's up to us to keep his legacy alive.""

Those cotton fields were in then-segregated Pike County, where Lewis winced at the signs designating ""whites only"" locations.

At his 1958 meeting with King, Rev. Ralph Abernathy and civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, Lewis talked about the possibility of a lawsuit to try to integrate the university in Troy, Gray recently recalled. The lawsuit ultimately did not happen because of concerns about retaliation his parents would face in the majority-white county.

""The fire inside John to do something about segregation continued to burn,"" Gray said. ""Even before he met Dr. King, he was interested in doing something about doing away with segregation. And he did it all his life.""

Resistance to racism started young

Lewis was one of 10 children born into a sharecropping family. His parents saved enough money to buy their own farm, where the children worked the fields and tended the animals. A young Lewis was less fond of field work — often grousing about the gruelling task — but eagerly took on the job of tending the chickens while practising preaching.

In his autobiography, Walking with the Wind, he described how as a youngster, he longed to go to the county's public library but wasn't allowed because it was for whites only.

""Even an eight-year-old could see there was something terribly wrong about that,"" Lewis wrote.

He would eventually apply for a library card there, knowing he would be refused, in what he considered his first official act of resistance to racial apartheid.

In 1955, he heard a new voice on the radio. It was King, who was leading the Montgomery bus boycott about 80 kilometres away.

Lewis became a leader of the Freedom Riders, often facing violent and angry crowds, and was jailed dozens of times. In 1961, he was beaten after arriving at the same Montgomery station where he arrived three years earlier to meet King. In 1965, his skull was fractured on the bridge in Selma in the melee that became known as Bloody Sunday.

His parents and siblings watched the news footage of the Selma beatings, worried that he would become the next civil rights martyr.

The Troy public library now has a sign outside honouring Lewis. Students at the university he wasn't allowed to attend now study his life and work.

Last year, Lewis announced he had been diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer.

Rosa Tyner, his sister, told The Associated Press that about a week before his death, she asked him about possibly seeing another doctor.

""He said, `No, I'm at peace. I'm at peace and I'm ready to go,""' she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/john-lewis-congressman-memorial-services-1.5663200?cmp=rss,news,world,
25561,2020-07-25 15:39,Bear Clan Patrol gets $1.2M boost to support chapter in Kenora,"Kenora's Bear Clan Patrol hit the city's streets on Friday after getting $1.2 million in funding as part of a year-long pilot project to get the community safety group off the ground.

""It's amazing,"" said Daryl Redsky, a founding member of the group's Kenora chapter. ""This money is going to put feet in the boots to hit the ground, and we've got about 10 boots to fill.""

The money from the Ontario government, which gave $800,000, and the Kenora District Services Board, which gave $400,000, will help the Indigenous-led group patrol the city's streets and public spaces 24/7, said Kenora-Rainy River MPP Greg Rickford in a news release on Friday.

""Today's investment is a direct response to the ongoing crisis in Kenora's downtown,"" said Rickford.

Patrollers will wear high-visibility vests and walk through Kenora's downtown core areas. The team will also have access to a mobile support worker with a vehicle to respond to calls, drive people to hospital or other places and bring needed items, the release said.

Redsky said he hopes the pilot project delivers positive results so the group can expand into surrounding communities.

""We'll be out there to assist our homeless, the vulnerable and also the community in general,"" Redsky said, adding that the group will be able to check on people in distress and offer to take them to a detoxification centre if needed.

""Once it meets people's expectations, our hope is that we will continue to be a program that's going to be funded for a long time.""

Winnipeg group hopes for similar support

The most recent iteration of the Bear Clan Patrol started in Winnipeg in 2015 , following the death of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine. The Kenora chapter started in 2016 — after 16-year-old Delaine Copenace's body was found in the Lake of the Woods — but didn't have the resources to run consistently until now, Redsky said.

The community-based crime prevention model now has several chapters across Canada.

James Favel, executive director and founder of the Winnipeg group, helped train members of the Kenora chapter. He said the money will go a long way in supporting vulnerable people in the Kenora area — and wants to also secure core funding for the Winnipeg chapter.

""This is what I was hoping that we could accomplish here in Winnipeg, and I'm still hoping that we will,"" he said. ""We've been doing the work for six years and we're still cobbling together little grants here and there.""

Redsky said he hopes the Kenora chapter will be able to hire people who have experienced homelessness to lead their group, as a way to give opportunities to vulnerable people by helping them find employment and to inspire youth.

""We will have individuals that will have gone through the lived experience and that have turned their lives around,"" he said. ""We need those kind of role models for our young people and someone that they can look up to.""

The pilot project will run until the end of July 2021, the release said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bear-clan-kenora-funding-1.5663271?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba
25560,2020-07-25 15:37,"Courthouse is ground zero in Portland, where federal agents, protesters use tear gas, fireworks","Thousands of protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in Portland, Ore., into the early hours of Saturday, shooting fireworks at the building as plumes of tear gas dispensed by U.S. agents lingered above.

The demonstration continued until federal agents entered the crowd at about 2:30 a.m. local time and marched in a line down the street, clearing remaining protesters with tear gas at close range. They also extinguished a large fire in the street outside the courthouse.

Portland has been roiled by nightly protests for two months following the killing by police of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. U.S. President Donald Trump said he sent federal agents to Oregon's largest city to halt the unrest, but state and local officials say they are making the situation worse.

The clashes in Portland have further inflamed the nation's political tensions and triggered a crisis over the limits of federal power as Trump moves to send U.S. officers to other Democratic-led cities he says are violent.

Late Friday a federal judge denied a request by Oregon's attorney general to restrict the actions of federal police.

The Federal Protective Service had declared the gathering in Portland that began Friday evening ""an unlawful assembly"" and said that officers had been injured.

As the crowd dispersed, someone was found stabbed nearby, Portland police said. The person was taken to a hospital and a suspect was taken into custody.

By 3 a.m., most demonstrators had left, with only some small groups roaming the streets.

Earlier Friday night, the protest had drawn various organized groups, including Healthcare Workers Protest, Teachers against Tyrants, Lawyers for Black Lives and the ""Wall of Moms."" As the crowd grew — authorities estimate there were 3,000 present at the peak of the protest — people were heard chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Feds go home"" to the sound of drums.

Later, protesters vigorously shook the fence surrounding the courthouse, shot fireworks toward the building and threw glass bottles. Many times these actions were met by federal agents using tear gas and flash bangs.

'It's extremely painful'

The flow of tear gas caused protesters to disperse at times, as others remained toward the front of the courthouse with leaf blowers directing the gas back to the building. Federal agents had leaf blowers of their own to counteract.

Daniel Pereyo was one protester who was tear-gassed.

Pereyo said he had been at the nearby park watching drummers and fireworks being shot when his face and eyes began to burn.

""It's extremely painful,"" he said. ""It's not the worst pain ever, but it is discomforting and it's distracting.""

As the clouds of gas floated down the street, protesters would swiftly regroup and return to chant and shake the fence that separates the people on the street from federal agents and the courthouse.

It was unclear whether anyone was arrested during the protest. The federal agents have arrested dozens during nightly demonstrations against racial injustice that often turn violent.

The state attorney general sued, saying some people had been whisked off the streets in unmarked vehicles. U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman ruled Friday the state lacked standing to sue on behalf of protesters because the lawsuit was a ""highly unusual one with a particular set of rules.""

Oregon was seeking a restraining order on behalf of its residents not for injuries that had already happened but to prevent injuries by federal officers in the future. That combination makes the standard for granting such a motion very narrow, and the state did not prove it had standing in the case, Mosman wrote.

Federal government accused of violating rights

Legal experts who reviewed the case before the decision warned that the judge could reject it on those grounds. A lawsuit from a person accusing federal agents of violating their rights to free speech or against unconstitutional search and seizure would have a much higher chance of success, Michael Dorf, a constitutional law professor at Cornell University, said ahead of the ruling.

""The federal government acted in violation of those individuals' rights and probably acted in violation of the Constitution in the sense of exercising powers that are reserved to the states, but just because the federal government acts in ways that overstep its authority doesn't mean the state has an injury,"" he said.

The lawsuit from Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum accused federal agents of arresting protesters without probable cause and using excessive force. She sought a temporary restraining order to ""immediately stop federal authorities from unlawfully detaining Oregonians.""

David Morrell, a lawyer for the U.S. government, called the motion ""extraordinary"" and told the judge in a hearing this week that it was based solely on ""a few threadbare declarations"" from witnesses and a Twitter video. Morrell called the protests ""dangerous and volatile.""

Rosenblum said the ramifications of the ruling were ""extremely troubling.""

""Individuals mistreated by these federal agents can sue for damages, but they can't get a judge to restrain this unlawful conduct more generally,"" she said in a statement.

Police said via Twitter they had made at least 16 arrests and were ""investigating a possible explosive damage"" to the walls of the city's East Precinct police station.

Authorities said rocks, bottles and mortars were thrown at officers as they attempted to clear the area. One officer was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an explosive.

Earlier, protesters in Seattle broke through a fence where a youth detention facility was being built, with some people setting a fire and damaging a portable trailer, authorities said.

Initially there was no sign of law enforcement near the Seattle march. Later, Seattle police said via Twitter that about a dozen people breached the construction site for the King County youth detention facility. Also, police said protesters broke out windows at a King County court facility.

Earlier this week King County Executive Dow Constantine said he would work to eliminate youth detention centres in the county by 2025 in response to long-standing demands by community activists.

After the fire at the construction site authorities said they had ordered people to leave a different area, in a section of Capitol Hill, near downtown, where the East Precinct is.

Earlier this month police cleared the ""Capitol Hill Occupied Protest"" zone after two fatal shootings. A group had occupied several blocks around a park for about two weeks following standoffs and clashes that were part of the nationwide unrest over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Prior to Saturday's protests, Seattle police Chief Carmen Best had announced officers would be armed with pepper spray and other weapons, promising officers would not use tear gas and urging demonstrators to remain peaceful.

""In the spirit of offering trust and full transparency, I want to advise you that SPD officers will be carrying pepper spray and blast balls today, as would be typical for events that carry potential to include violence,"" Best said.

At an emergency hearing on Friday night, U.S. District Judge James Robart granted a request from the federal government to block Seattle's new law prohibiting police from using pepper spray, blast balls and similar weapons.

The temporary restraining order halts the law that the Seattle City Council passed unanimously last month after confrontations that have largely been peaceful but were occasionally marked by violence, looting and highway shutdowns.

25556,2020-07-25 14:07,Somalia's parliament ousts prime minister in vote of no-confidence amid power struggle,"Somalia's parliament ousted Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire in a no-confidence vote on Saturday, as a simmering power struggle between him and the president came to the fore.

Khaire and President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed have been tussling over whether to delay a national election due in February next year, with the prime minister insisting it go ahead and the president favouring postponement.

Mohamed elevated Deputy Prime Minister Mahdi Mohamed Guled to prime minister in an acting capacity, a statement issued by his office said, citing the need for continuity of government programs.

The president's allies have also accused Khaire of failing to stabilize the security situation.

""The government failed in its promise on the preparation of a clear plan for the one-man, one-vote election,"" said Mohamed Mursal Sheikh Abdirahman, the speaker of parliament, referring to the first direct election since civil war erupted in 1991.

The Horn of Africa country has been holding elections through representatives like elders in the past decade, due to insecurity caused by al-Shabaab militants in most areas.

Mohamed Abukar Islow, the internal security minister and a key ally of Khaire, accused the speaker and the president of plotting to remove the prime minister to extend their terms.

""It is a dark day,"" Islow said, terming the move unconstitutional due to the requirement that an election be held every four years. Khaire, a former oil company executive, was not immediately available for a comment.

The president pledged to hold ""a satisfactory election"" within the schedule, but the Forum of National Parties, a leading opposition group, was skeptical.

""The president is breeding political chaos that will be difficult to manage.... We warn against any attempt aimed at term extension,"" the group said.

Rashid Abdi, an independent Horn of Africa analyst, said Khaire's removal was inevitable because of differences with the president and the prime minister's ambition to be president one day.

""What was surprising was the swiftness with which it was done. There was no debate or negotiations,"" Abdi said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/somalia-parliament-prime-minister-1.5663236?cmp=rss,news,world,

25553,2020-07-25 13:27,Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green dies at 73,"Peter Green, the dexterous blues guitarist who led the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac in a career shortened by psychedelic drugs and mental illness, has died at 73.

A law firm representing his family, Swan Turton, announced the death in a statement Saturday. It said he died ""peacefully in his sleep"" this weekend. A further statement will be issued in the coming days.

Green, to some listeners, was the best of the British blues guitarists of the 1960s. B.B. King once said Green ""has the sweetest tone I ever heard. He was the only one who gave me the cold sweats.""

Green also made a mark as a composer with Albatross, and as a songwriter with Oh Well and Black Magic Woman.

He crashed out of the band in 1971. Even so, Mick Fleetwood said in an interview with The Associated Press in 2017 that Green deserves the lion's share of the credit for the band's success.

""Peter was asked why did he call the band Fleetwood Mac. He said, `Well, you know I thought maybe I'd move on at some point and I wanted Mick and John (McVie) to have a band.' End of story, explaining how generous he was,"" said Fleetwood, who described Green as a standout in an era of great guitar work.

Gifted with guitar at age 10

Indeed, Green was so fundamental to the band that in its early days, it was called Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.

Peter Allen Greenbaum was born on Oct. 29, 1946, in London. The gift of a cheap guitar put the 10-year-old Green on a musical path.

He was barely out of his teens when he got his first big break in 1966, replacing Eric Clapton in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers — initially for just a week in 1965 after Clapton abruptly took off for a Greek holiday. Clapton quit for good soon after and Green was in.

In the Bluesbreakers, he was reunited with Mick Fleetwood, a former colleague in Peter B's Looners. Mayall added bass player McVie soon after.

Members of the band Fleetwod Mac appear at the podium after being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in New York City on Jan. 12, 1998. From the left: John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks, Peter Green and Lindsey Buckingham. (Reuters)

The three departed the next year, forming the core of the band initially billed as ""Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring (guitarist) Jeremy Spencer.""

Fleetwood Mac made its debut at the British Blues and Jazz festival in the summer of 1967, which led to a recording contract, then an eponymous first album in February 1968. The album, which included ""Long Grey Mare"" and three other songs by Green, stayed on the British charts for 13 months.

The band's early albums were heavy blues-rock affairs marked by Green's fluid, evocative guitar style and gravelly vocals. Notable singles included Oh Well and the Latin-flavoured Black Magic Woman, later a hit for Carlos Santana.

But as the band flourished, Green became increasingly erratic, even paranoid. Drugs played a part in his unraveling.

On a tour in California, Green became acquainted with Augustus Owsley Stanley III, notorious supplier of powerful LSD to the The Grateful Dead and Ken Kesey, the anti-hero of Tom Wolfe's book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.

""He was taking a lot of acid and mescaline around the same time his illness began manifesting itself more and more,"" Fleetwood said in 2015. ""We were oblivious as to what schizophrenia was back in those days, but we knew something was amiss.""

Green Manalishi, Green's last single for the band, reflected his distress.

In an interview with Johnny Black for Mojo magazine, Green said: ""I was dreaming I was dead and I couldn't move, so I fought my way back into my body. I woke up and looked around. It was very dark and I found myself writing a song. It was about money; The Green Manalishi is money.""

Drugs and mental illness took a toll

In some of his last appearances with the band, he wore a monk's robe and a crucifix. Fearing that he had too much money, he tried to persuade other band members to give their earnings to charities.

Green left Fleetwood Mac for good in 1971.

In his absence, the band's new lineup, including Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, gained enormous success with a more pop-tinged sound.

Green was confined in a mental hospital in 1977 after an incident with his manager. Testimony in court said Green had asked for money and then threatened to shoot out the windows of the manager's office.

He was released later in the year and married Jane Samuels, a Canadian, in 1978. They had a daughter, Rosebud, and divorced the following year. Green also has a son, Liam Firlej.

Green returned to performing in the 1990s with the Peter Green Splinter Group.

25555,2020-07-25 13:25,U.S. removes 14-day quarantine for golfers at PGA Tour events,"Player, caddies and other essential golf personnel entering the United States for a PGA Tour event no longer must quarantine for 14 days.

Officials in the White House made the decision on Friday, and players were notified late in the day in an email, multiple outlets reported Saturday.

The email stated that players and support personnel won't be subject to the quarantine because the PGA Tour requires rigorous testing for COVID-19 and takes other health and safety precautions.

The change allows players to enter two of the biggest events of the abbreviated season: the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in Memphis, which begins Thursday, and the PGA Championship at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco the following week.

Lee Westwood, a former World No. 1 player now ranked No. 34, told reporters Saturday at the British Masters that the policy change won't affect his plans to stay in Europe.

""I know they've dropped the two-week quarantine now, but I still don't feel comfortable and I don't feel like it is right to jump on a plane for 12 hours,"" the Englishman said. ""I've felt like out of my comfort zone this week, so, if I got to Memphis, I would feel uncomfortable playing golf tournaments at the moment.""

Players will be subject to travel requirements of their countries when they return home.

Westwood, 47, continued:

""There is a lot more to consider. The two American tournaments, next week and the following week, I'm still concerned that America doesn't take it (the virus) as seriously as the rest of the world. It still seems to be one of the hot spots for outbreaks. I can control me not getting the virus and take all the measures I can, but somebody might pass it on. I don't really want to get ill with it and I'm slightly asthmatic. If I tested [positive] in Memphis I would have to stay there for two weeks.

25559,2020-07-25 11:00,"The week B.C. slipped: With COVID-19 cases on the rise, officials warn against pandemic fatigue","If you live in B.C. and have been watching the province's COVID-19 case numbers climb with growing unease this week, you're not alone.

B.C. has so far been heralded as a COVID-19 success story, having flattened its curve relatively early and avoided the worst-case scenario that would have seen intensive care units overwhelmed.

But cases have been steadily ticking upwards since the province entered Phase 3 of its gradual reopening — a scenario Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry warned would happen as people expanded their social bubbles.

B.C. health officials aren't in crisis mode just yet — saying because the surge isn't equally distributed across the province, and is largely contained to a particular demographic (younger people), it's not time to hit the panic button.

But for the first time since the height of the pandemic, health officials spent much of the week warning the public to pull back on social interactions, and ""recommit"" to physical distancing. And in a first since the province began to reopen, new public health orders were brought in to curb the spread of the virus, with Henry calling this week in B.C. ""a turning point.""

1,000 people isolating after B.C.'s largest public outbreak

On Friday afternoon the province announced a new community outbreak, this time on Haida Gwaii, with 13 total confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date.

And nearly 1,000 British Columbians are currently in self-isolation, with up to 86 cases now linked to public gatherings and parties in the Kelowna area.

Before the Kelowna outbreak, B.C. had avoided this kind of large, potentially super-spreading event. Previous outbreaks, including one in a neo-natal unit in Vancouver this week, were confined to workplaces, detention centres, health-care settings or long-term care homes.

Henry said the Kelowna outbreak is a prime example of why people need to keep groups small — to make contact tracing effective. In some cases related to the Kelowna gatherings, people had been in contact with people they did not know, making contact tracing impossible.

As a result of the outbreak, the province has announced new restrictions limiting the number of people allowed on rental properties and boats, including houseboats.

Henry also announced new measures for restaurants, bars and nightclubs. All patrons will be required to be seated, alcohol self-service will not be available (which means no ordering from the bar), and dance floors will be closed. Henry also reiterated that people should not be moving tables together or attempting to exceed the limit on six people at gatherings, after a number of restaurants reported that people were trying to bend the rules.

'You're better than that'

In the age of physical distancing and camera phones, no bending of the rules goes unposted.

It was a lesson learned this week by revellers at a Third Beach drum circle in Vancouver, and by Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart himself.

On Tuesday night, images of hundreds of people drumming and dancing on the beach spread quickly on social media, drawing widespread condemnation.

Henry addressed the images, saying that while the likelihood of spread is lower outdoors, the risk is not zero. She said people should enjoy B.C.'s beaches, but keep groups small and distanced from others.

Meanwhile, Stewart was photographed last week sitting at a West End restaurant patio table with seven other people, violating a public health order that allows no more than six people to sit together at a restaurant table. He later explained he and his wife were joined by two other couples from his immediate family for a meal outside. He said the group grew when more family members arrived, noting ""it's easy to make a mistake.""

When pressed about public faux pas in COVID-19 briefings, Dix and Henry repeatedly said the vast majority of British Columbians appear to be following public health guidelines, and that instances where they are being violated tend to garner significant attention because they happen in public.

But commenting on a number of events this week, Premier John Horgan was less forgiving in his tone, saying ""I have to say to British Columbians: Come on. You're better than that.""

Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam called on Canadians to resist giving in to pandemic fatigue as novel coronavirus cases among young people surge. Across Canada, cases in people under the age of 39 account for 60 per cent of new cases reported this week, with over a third ending up in hospital.

New guidelines for safe sex

This week the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) listed new guidelines for safe sex during the pandemic. The BCCDC said masturbation is the most risk-free choice — ""you are your safest partner"" — and that your next-safest sex partner is someone in your household, or someone who has close contact with you and nobody else.

But officials also acknowledged not everyone has sex exclusively with a single, live-in partner, and provided practical guidance for people hoping to be safely intimate.

People who are dating or having casual sex should avoid kissing and wear a mask, as ""heavy breathing during sex can create more droplets that may transmit COVID-19.""

The centre recommended choosing sexual positions that limit face-to-face contact. It said condoms, lubricant and dental dams should be used to reduce contact with saliva, semen and feces during sex. (The virus has been found in semen and feces, but it is not yet clear if the coronavirus can be sexually transmitted.)

""Use barriers, like walls (e.g., glory holes), that allow for sexual contact but prevent close face-to-face contact,"" the guidelines state.

B.C. matching $1 billion

A week after projecting a $12.5 billion deficit, the B.C. government said it is matching $1 billion in federal government money to address the impacts of COVID-19 and help restart the economy.

Premier John Horgan said in a news release the funding will secure some of B.C.'s share of the federal government's $19-billion ""Safe Restart'' plan for the country. It says the money will support local governments and transit operators that have revenue shortfalls created by the pandemic.

Advocacy group opposes plan to mandate tests on farms

A group representing migrant workers is criticizing a proposal to mandate COVID-19 tests on farms in southwestern Ontario.

But Premier Doug Ford and the medical officer of health in Windsor-Essex say they are considering the measure.

Farms have been hard hit by the novel coronavirus in recent weeks.

Officials announced on Friday that Windsor-Essex now has the highest rate of COVID-19 in the province.

During his province-wide tour on Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he may consult a constitutional lawyer to help the province decide if it can make COVID-19 testing mandatory for migrant workers on farms. (CBC)

Announcement on Stage 3 coming next Wednesday

Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex continue to be in Stage 2 of the province's reopening plan, but the premier has said an update on whether or not they will be able to proceed to Stage 3 will be made next Wednesday.

Ford said on Friday that health officials have asked for more time to ""analyze the numbers"" in the three areas.

""And I've always said, we can't rush this,"" Ford told reporters. ""I'm hopeful we'll have some good news to share on Wednesday.""

Stage 3, among other things, means residents would be allowed to dine indoors at restaurants or drink in pubs. Gyms and movie theatres would also be allowed to reopen.

Under Stage 3, limits on gatherings would increase to a maximum of 50 people indoors and a maximum of 100 people outdoors, with physical distancing in place.

The Windsor-Essex area now has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, the region's top doctor said Friday as community spread and outbreaks on local farms continued to grow.

Medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed said new case rates in the southwestern Ontario region passed Toronto and Peel this week with 484 cases per 100,000 people.

Whether it's because they're returning to work or socializing more, COVID-19 is becoming more common in young people, says infectious disease researcher Craig Jenne. 6:32

Ahmed said the surge may be attributable to loosened public health restrictions that took effect when the region entered Stage 2 of the provincial economic recovery plan weeks ago. The cases are ""stretching"" local hospital capacity in Windsor and Leamington, Ont., he added.

Windsor-Essex reported 53 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, attributing 43 of those to agri-food workers.

Newfoundland and Labrador reported one new confirmed case of COVID-19 on Friday, involving a woman in the Eastern Health region between the ages of 20 and 39.

The woman is a resident of the province who had recently returned from travel in Southeast Asia. Officials say the woman was symptomatic during her return home and went into self-isolation upon her arrival.

The province has reported a total of 265 cases of COVID-19, 259 of which are considered recovered.

Vietnam reported its first local coronavirus infection for more than three months on Saturday after a man in the central city of Danang tested positive four

times for the virus, a government statement said.

Thanks to strict quarantine measures and an aggressive and widespread testing program, Vietnam had kept its virus total to an impressively low 415 cases, and had reported no locally transmitted infections for 100 days.

In the Philippines, thousands of people were crammed into a baseball stadium in Manila on Saturday, breaking social distancing rules despite coronavirus risks, after people wanting to return to their home provinces flooded a government transportation program.

Officials had reserved the stadium as a place to test people before transporting them back to their home provinces under a program to help people who had lost their jobs in the capital return to their families elsewhere.

Officials had planned for 7,500 people to arrive at the stadium from Friday, but were caught out when another 2,000 people who were not yet scheduled to travel headed there anyway.

Hong Kong reported 133 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, including 126 that were locally transmitted, a record for a daily increase, as authorities warned that the city faces a critical period in containing the virus.

The Asian financial hub reported 123 new cases on Friday, after it extended strict social distancing measures this week.

Since late January, more than 2,000 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 18 of whom have died.

25545,2020-07-25 7:00,Author Helen Knott raises $3000 writing prize for single parents,"As a single parent, author Helen Knott struggled to make ends meet. Now that she's had work published, she's ready to pay it forward to others by giving away a grassroots writing prize.

""I've received a lot of support from people along my journey as a writer, so for me it's about making writing seem like a possibility for another single parent,"" said Knott.

Knott is Dane Zaa and Cree-Métis from Prophet River First Nation and is the author of bestselling book In My Own Moccassins: A Memoir of Resilience.

Earlier this week, Knott decided that she wanted to give back to aspiring authors — specifically single parents — by putting a call out for writing submissions, complete with a $150 prize and a one-on-one writing consultation with the author as the prize.

Immediately after the call for submissions was posted, Knott started receiving donations from people on social media — people who read her book, but also authors like The Marrow Thieves' Cherie Dimaline.

The money for the writing contest grew from her contribution of $150, to $300, to $1,000 and now sits at two prizes worth $1,500 each.

""I didn't expect people to start sending in money,"" said Knott. ""I thought it was small and it's grown way bigger than what I thought it was going to be.""

Paying it forward

In 2014, a few people in her community chipped in to help buy Knott a laptop that she needed to get into a writing program at the Banff Centre. Knott said without that generosity, she would not be able to pursue writing as a career, especially as a single mother.

""I remember the struggle of trying to raise my son and write my book,"" said Knott. ""It was really hard for me at that time.""

She said she comes from a proud people, and when she got the laptop, her dad cried.

Knott said that a lot of writing contests often have barriers like submission fees or very specific writing requirements. With her prize, she wants to make it accessible and barrier-free to encourage anyone who is a single parent to submit.

She chose to include the mentorship to help any emerging writers who are selected. After she won the now-discontinued RBC Taylor Prize, she was mentored by nehiyaw author Darrel McLeod, who has continued to work with her and give feedback and mentorship.

Darrel McLeod is the author of Mamaskatch. He said its important to create a community of support for emerging writers. (Ilja Herb, Douglas & McIntyre)

McLeod, who is from Lesser Slave Lake Alberta, is the author of Mamaskatch, which won the Governor General's Literary Award for nonfiction in 2018.

""I wanted to offer that to somebody — to be able to read their work, and talk with them about where they can improve, what they're doing right and any other questions that they may have, so I'm excited for that to take place,"" Knott said.

McLeod has also stepped in as one of the contributors to the prize. He says that it is tough to get published and he has found what he calls an ""Indigenous writing family.""

""As a newer author, it was really hard to find support. There's people out there trying to make it. And my biggest support came from Eden Robinson,"" said McLeod.

McLeod encourages people to submit to Knott's writing contest.

The contest is open to single parents in Canada. Knott said that submissions could be any genre, including fantasy or poetry or whatever people feel like and the deadline is August 22nd at midnight. A winner will be announced in September.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/author-helen-knott-raises-3000-writing-prize-for-single-parents-1.5662568?cmp=rss,news,indigenous,
25544,2020-07-25 5:41,Federal agents use tear gas on Portland protesters,"A persistent crowd of protesters remained outside the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon, into the early hours of Saturday as fireworks were shot at the building and plumes of tear gas, dispensed by U.S. agents, lingered above.

Thousands of people gathered in Portland streets hours after a U.S. judge denied Oregon's request to restrict federal agents' actions when they arrest people during protests that have roiled the city and pitted local officials against the Trump administration.

By 8 p.m., a few hundred people, most wearing masks and many donning helmets, had already gathered near a fountain, one spot where groups meet before marching to the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and the federal agents there. They chanted and clapped along to the sound of thunderous drums, pausing to listen to speakers.

Among various organized groups, including Healthcare Workers Protest, Teachers against Tyrants, Lawyers for Black Lives and the ""Wall of Moms,"" was Portland Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, who spoke to protesters outside the Justice Center.

Beginning at 9 p.m., the crowd of people, pressed shoulder to shoulder, packed the area and overflowed into the streets as they chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Feds go home"" to the sound of drums.

As the night carried on, protesters vigorously shook the fence surrounding the courthouse and shot fireworks and threw glass bottles. Many times these actions were met by federal agents with tear gas and flash bangs.

The flow of tear gas caused many protesters to retreat or disperse, some becoming sick as others remained with leaf blowers directing the gas back to the court house.

As the clouds of gas floated down the street, protesters returned to chant and vigorously shake the fence that separates the people on the street from federal agents and the courthouse.

The federal agents, deployed by President Donald Trump to tamp down the unrest, have arrested dozens during nightly demonstrations against racial injustice that often turn violent. Democratic leaders in Oregon say federal intervention has worsened the two-month crisis, and the state attorney general sued to allege that some people had been whisked off the streets in unmarked vehicles.

U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman said the state lacked standing to sue on behalf of protesters because the lawsuit was a ""highly unusual one with a particular set of rules.""

Oregon was seeking a restraining order on behalf of its residents not for injuries that had already happened but to prevent injuries by federal officers in the future. That combination makes the standard for granting such a motion very narrow, and the state did not prove it had standing in the case, Mosman wrote.

Legal experts who reviewed the case before the decision warned that he could reject it on those grounds. A lawsuit from a person accusing federal agents of violating their rights to free speech or against unconstitutional search and seizure would have a much higher chance of success, Michael Dorf, a constitutional law professor at Cornell University, said ahead of the ruling.

""The federal government acted in violation of those individuals' rights and probably acted in violation of the Constitution in the sense of exercising powers that are reserved to the states, but just because the federal government acts in ways that overstep its authority doesn't mean the state has an injury,"" he said.

The clashes in Portland have further inflamed the nation's political tensions and triggered a crisis over the limits of federal power as Trump moves to send U.S. officers to other Democratic-led cities to combat crime. It's playing out as Trump pushes a new ""law and order"" reelection strategy after the coronavirus crashed the economy.

Protesters in Portland have been targeting the federal courthouse, setting fires outside and vandalizing the building that U.S. authorities say they have a duty to protect. Federal agents have used tear gas, less-lethal ammunition that left one person critically injured and other force to scatter protesters.

Restraining order sought

The lawsuit from Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum accused federal agents of arresting protesters without probable cause and using excessive force. She sought a temporary restraining order to ""immediately stop federal authorities from unlawfully detaining Oregonians.""

David Morrell, an attorney for the U.S. government, called the motion ""extraordinary"" and told the judge in a hearing this week that it was based solely on ""a few threadbare declarations"" from witnesses and a Twitter video. Morrell called the protests ""dangerous and volatile.""

Rosenblum said the ramifications of the ruling were ""extremely troubling.""

""While I respect Judge Mosman, I would ask this question: If the state of Oregon does not have standing to prevent this unconstitutional conduct by unidentified federal agents running roughshod over her citizens, who does?"" Rosenblum said in a statement. ""Individuals mistreated by these federal agents can sue for damages, but they can't get a judge to restrain this unlawful conduct more generally.""

Before the federal intervention, Mayor Ted Wheeler and other local leaders had said a small cadre of violent activists were drowning out the message of peaceful protesters. But the Democrat, who was tear-gassed this week as he joined protesters, says the federal presence is exacerbating a tense situation and he's repeatedly told them to leave.

Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf denied that federal agents were inflaming the situation in Portland and said Wheeler legitimized criminality by joining demonstrators, whom Trump has called ""anarchists and agitators.""

In the lawsuit, Oregon had asked the judge to command agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Protective Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to stop detaining protesters without probable cause, to identify themselves before arresting anyone and to explain why an arrest is taking place.

Protesters use lasers

Agents have arrested 28 people in Portland this week, including seven from Thursday night's protests, when they used tear gas to force thousands of demonstrators from crowding around the courthouse. Protesters projected lasers on the building and tried to take down a security fence. They scattered as clouds of gas rose up and agents fired crowd control munitions.

The Department of Homeland Security said that during Thursday's demonstrations one federal officer was injured and that ""no injuries to protesters or rioters have been reported.""

Wolf said Tuesday that at least 43 people have been arrested on federal charges at that point.

They face federal charges including assaulting federal officers, arson and damaging federal property, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams said. All the defendants are local and were released after making a court appearance.

U.S. officers ""working to protect the courthouse have been subjected to nightly threats and assaults from demonstrators while performing their duties,"" according to a statement from Williams' office.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/portland-protest-1.5663080?cmp=rss,news,world,
25542,2020-07-25 4:00,"David Cochrane: Threats against politicians 'very frequent', former Privy Council clerk says","Canada's former top civil servant says Canadians would be shocked and ""dismayed"" to learn the true level of abuse and the number of violent threats politicians face during their time in office.

""It's a very hostile environment to go into public life and we pay a price for that,"" former clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick told CBC Radio's The House. ""It's a slide towards a degree of violence in our politics which I think we should resist.""

Wernick said there is a ""certain innocence"" in Canada when it comes to political violence.

""I think Canadians would be dismayed to know that the people that step up and run for office and serve their country for a period of time are sent videos on how to commit suicide,"" he said.

""The most vile kinds of messages are sent to them attacking their gender, their religion, their race and so on.""

The former clerk of the Privy Council talks about the current threat of political violence in Canada. 11:54

Wernick made headlines in early 2019 when he testified before the House of Commons justice committee investigating the SNC-Lavalin controversy. The 40-year civil servant used his prepared remarks to comment on what he called the coarsening of political debate and the risk it poses to the people who run for office.

""I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence when people use terms like 'treason' and 'traitor' in open discourse,"" Wernick told the committee in February of last year. ""Those are the words that lead to assassination. I'm worried that somebody is going to be shot in this country, this year, during the political campaign.""

At the time, many felt Wernick's comments were alarmist and over-the-top. But now, 17 months later, two men have been charged in separate incidents for allegedly threatening the life of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

WATCH | Michael Wernick warns about the state of political discourse in 2019 testimony

‘I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,’ said Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council. 5:31

Corey Hurren, a Canadian Armed Forces reservist from Manitoba, faces 22 charges for allegedly smashing the security gate at Rideau Hall with his pickup truck and then setting out on foot toward the prime minister's house, heavily armed. Hurren also has been accused of threatening Trudeau.

André Audet of Boucherville, Que. was arrested and charged by the RCMP's national security team for allegedly making online posts that called for Trudeau's death and the eradication of Muslims.

""There are serious threats to people in office all the time and it's important that that be taken seriously,"" said Wernick, who during his time in the Privy Council Office (PCO) was briefed regularly on security and threat assessments.

""It's very frequent. I can't put numbers to it but I was constantly exposed to it.""

Toxic language in politics a pathway to violence

That exposure started for Wernick during his first month in the PCO as the deputy clerk. That's when a gunman fatally shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo while he stood guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The shooter then stormed Parliament Hill, where he was killed in a gun battle in the Hall of Honour as MPs and staff barricaded themselves in meeting rooms and offices.

Wernick was with then-PCO clerk Janice Charette at the time and was evacuated to a safe location.

""We spent a very tense afternoon during that incident and I spent a lot of my time as deputy clerk on issues around the safety of the prime minister,"" Wernick said.

That work led Wernick to some strong conclusions. He argues that the increasingly toxic language used in politics (amplified by what he's called ""the vomitorium of social media"") is a pathway to violence — an inevitable outcome of the dehumanization and vilification of political opponents.

""Particularly when we're talking about starting to characterize your opponents more as enemies or even as traitors,"" Wernick said. ""That's ground that is just not responsible for people in office or candidates for office.""

Sussex Drive currently not a safe place for families

Wernick retired in April 2019 — in large part due to the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin controversy. As such, he no longer has access to security briefings. So while he doesn't know more than anyone else about the recent attack at Rideau Hall, he said it laid bare the security weaknesses that exist in Canada's official residences.

Wernick said that 24 Sussex Drive — the official yet uninhabited residence of the prime minister — would need significant security upgrades in addition to long overdue maintenance to make it safe for a prime minister with children.

""Frankly, it's never going to be a safe place for somebody [with] a family to live, unless some very, very expensive upgrades are put into those premises,"" he said.

Trudeau and his family split their time between Rideau Cottage and the PM's summer residence at Harrington Lake. After decades of neglect, the projected cost of making 24 Sussex habitable is high, even before the security upgrades Wernick is calling for are taken into account.

A report by the National Capital Commission released in 2018 said it'll cost approximately $83 million to restore and maintain Canada's official residences, including 24 Sussex Drive. (Tom Hanson/Canadian Press)

The politics of spending large sums of public money on official residences has long stood in the way of those repairs. Wernick said the country needs to take politics out of those decisions.

""I think we have to be honest about the costs of personal protection for the prime minister and cabinet ministers and not subject it to the small politics of, 'Well, how could you spend so much money upgrading your residence' in an age of drones and sniper rifles and car bombs,"" Wernick said.

""We need to provide safe places for people who are obviously public targets to live in. And so, let's have an honest conversation about what it would actually cost to keep people safe while they're serving us.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/david-cochrane-threats-against-politicians-very-frequent-former-privy-council-clerk-says-1.5661747?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25534,2020-07-25 4:00,Why some Canadian governments might be thinking about early elections — and why that might be a bad idea,"Even in the best of times, there's always an element of political risk when a minority government calls a snap election. That risk is exponentially greater in the midst of a pandemic — and yet, some governments across the country may be tempted.

But not one of them has been bold enough to pull the plug yet.

The temptation is understandable. Across the country, parties in power are seeing a surge in support over their handling of the pandemic.

A bump in the polls is often the root cause of early elections. Minority governments tend to end for one of two reasons: a popular governing party believes it can turn a minority into a majority, or the opposition believes an unpopular governing party is ripe for replacement.

Fixed election date laws in most provinces prevent majority governments from cashing in on newfound support. While these laws can be bypassed easily, voter revulsion usually has kept majority governments from trying it.

But these polling surges could make some minority governments think about rolling the dice — unless COVID-19 makes them think twice.

Speculation about the possibility of a late summer election in New Brunswick was feverish just recently. Premier Blaine Higgs has presided over a fragile minority government since 2018. The most recent big survey, conducted by Narrative Research in May , put his Progressive Conservatives 18 percentage points ahead of the opposition Liberals. That's quite a swing from his party's six-point deficit in the popular vote in the last election.

But this week, Higgs voiced some doubts about holding an election in the short term . While he didn't rule one out entirely, he said it wasn't his preference and he acknowledged ""there's mixed feelings, because many people would say, 'Is there a need? Is there a bigger concern around the health risks?'""

Asked this week about the possibility of an early election, British Columbia Premier John Horgan said that a vote is ""mandated by next October. So, there's an opportunity this fall. There's an opportunity next spring. There's an opportunity next summer.''

It's the first inkling Horgan has given that an election is on his mind.

His statement was denounced by B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson. It also drew fire from B.C. Green Leader Adam Olsen, with whom Horgan's New Democrats have an agreement to keep their government running.

With only a year left before the clock runs out, B.C.'s minority government has been remarkably stable. Most minority governments fall within two years. But Horgan's poll numbers are up significantly. The most recent survey by EKOS Research puts the gap between the NDP and the Liberals at 17 points — enough to deliver the widest margin of victory of any B.C. election since 2001.

B.C. Premier John Horgan has presided over a minority government since 2017, but for the first time polls suggest he has a wide lead over his opposition rivals. (Chad Hipolito / Canadian Press)

In Newfoundland and Labrador, an election must be held within a year of a new premier being sworn in. The governing Liberals will name their new leader next month — at which point the clock starts ticking.

But not all minority governments are eyeing the exits. There has been little talk of an early election in Prince Edward Island, where one poll suggests Dennis King's PC government enjoys a 32-point lead over the opposition Greens and Liberals.

In Ottawa, the federal Liberals are still leading in the polls by a significant margin . It is unclear what impact the WE contract controversy will have on Liberal support in the longer term; in the meantime, the opposition Conservatives appear content with extracting their pound of flesh from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

Despite the Liberals' sudden vulnerability, the Conservatives have not threatened to bring down the government (though the Bloc Québécois said on Friday it would try to defeat the government in September if Trudeau and Morneau do not resign). But because of that vulnerability, it appears unlikely the Liberals will take the risk of calling an election on their own — something which seemed plausible (if risky) just a few weeks ago.

COVID-19 makes no exceptions for democracy

There's one very good reason why minority governments — even popular ones — ought to think twice before kicking off an election campaign right now: the global pandemic that has killed over 600,000 people, including nearly 9,000 Canadians.

After dropping to an average of some 270 cases per day in early July from 1,800 or so at its peak in May, the country is now averaging about 500 new cases per day. There have been spikes in Alberta and Saskatchewan and rising trend lines in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia.

Canadians are increasingly worried about pandemic. The weekly tracking survey from Léger shows the percentage of Canadians afraid of contracting the disease increased 10 points over the last few weeks to 61 per cent — the highest level since April. The same poll found that 82 per cent of respondents believe there will be a second wave of infections.

Polls suggest Canadians' concerns over COVID-19 are rising again as the number of new cases increases. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press)

That would make an early election call perilous. The rising caseload — along with the cautionary tale offered by the uncontrolled spread of the disease in the United States — means the political blowback against any party seen as responsible for forcing a dangerous early election could be ruinous.

Risking people's lives for the sake of political gain is something most voters would find appalling. It also would make a four-week campaign unpredictable. The COVID-19 situation in Canada a month ago looked much different than it does now. How it will look in another four weeks is anybody's guess.

That might be enough to hold governing parties back from the brink. Opposition parties also need to be careful not to engineer — or allow themselves to be blamed for — a government's defeat.

That's a particularly acute risk for parties without leaders. The federal Conservatives and Greens, as well as the P.E.I. Liberals and the B.C. Greens, are all in the midst of their own leadership campaigns.

Voting in the time of COVID

Elections officials still have to be prepared for an early election, even if it's not likely to happen.

Canada will get its first taste of pandemic campaigning in Saskatchewan in just a few months. The province is scheduled to hold its fixed-date provincial election on Oct. 26. The province's electoral authority is building up its stocks of masks and hand sanitizer and is planning to implement physical distancing measures in polling places and encourage voters to bring their own pens or pencils.

But it's the situation south of the border which could shape many Canadians' views of what an election looks like in a pandemic climate.

As the number of new cases and deaths continues to rise in the United States, the country is still going ahead with its constitutionally-required election on Nov. 3. It might not go well.

Most states will allow Americans to vote by mail, but a few states might still require voters to state a reason for requesting a mail-in ballot. Fear of contracting a deadly disease in some of these states will not fit the bill.

Mail-in voting is also not without its issues. Not every voter has equal access to reliable postal service. Voter registration rules will differ from one state to another — unlike federal elections in Canada, U.S. federal elections are run at the state level — and the validation measures for every ballot will not be uniform.

For many Americans, in-person voting will be their best or only option and long lines at a reduced number of polling locations — such as the ones we saw in a few states during the presidential primaries — could discourage turnout.

In a country with a history of legislated attempts to disenfranchise Black and other minority voters, the potential for entire swathes of the electorate to struggle to have their ballots counted is huge.

It also doesn't help that U.S. President Donald Trump has actively tried to undermine the legitimacy of the result in advance, making unfounded claims that mail-in voting will be rife with voter fraud . Complicating things further is the fact that, with so many mail-in ballots to count, the results could be unclear for a few days.

It all could be enough to put any Canadian voter off the idea of an election until the pandemic is well behind us. But the timing of that election could depend in part on whether Canadian politicians believe the rewards might be greater than the risks.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-covid-minority-election-1.5662235?cmp=rss,news,politics,

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.

It may be hard to believe, but it's been exactly six months to the day since Canada's first case of COVID-19 was announced.

Since then, more than 100,000 Canadians have been infected with COVID-19 and almost 9,000 have died — over 80 per cent in long-term care homes.

Globally, cases have now topped 15 million.

Throughout the pandemic, Canada's top public health officials have faced scrutiny, praise and backlash for the choices they've made since that first case was announced on Jan. 25.

As Canada braces for a second wave that threatens to overwhelm hospitals and push Canadians back into lockdown, CBC News spoke to key officials across the country about what gives them hope — and concern — in the coming months.

Dr. Bonnie Henry

British Columbia's provincial health officer has been called one of the most effective public health officials in the world after successfully flattening the curve in the province when it seemed early on it would be overrun with COVID-19.

""We got hit hard and early,"" she told CBC News in two recent interviews.

Henry acted quickly to clamp down on outbreaks across B.C. before they spun out of control, taking the province from one of the most at risk early in the pandemic to one of the fastest to reopen safely .

""The timing that we had, the recognition of a couple of big super-spreading events in a conference that was held here and then in our long-term care homes early on — those were the things that we responded to,"" she said.

Henry said outbreaks in households in B.C., meat processing plants in Alberta and the accommodations of undocumented workers in Ontario showed how different the experience has been with COVID-19 across the country.

""It's really hard to compare. There's a lot of differences around timing, around access to tests, around population density and recognition of certain outbreaks early enough,"" she said. ""These are the things that we've all been learning across the country.""

To date, B.C. has had just under 3,400 COVID-19 cases and 189 deaths — a response that could have been much worse for a province of more than five million people.

In the coming months, Henry said, she is most hopeful about the reopening of schools in B.C. and aims to have elementary school students back in the classroom full-time in September.

WATCH | Luck, sound decisions helped B.C. avoid worst-case scenario:

British Columbia avoided the worst-case scenario during the COVID-19 pandemic largely because of its well co-ordinated messaging, sound decisions and a little bit of luck. 6:45

""We're also contingency planning,"" she cautioned. ""If we get a major outbreak and lots of cases in the community and things start to get hairy, then we have plans to step back to partial in-class or if needed to full online teaching.""

Henry said her biggest concerns moving forward are the reintroduction of visitors into long-term care homes and travellers from other provinces and the reopening of the U.S. border — particularly since B.C.'s first cases were tied to outbreaks in Washington state.

Henry said she hopes to maintain a ""sweet spot"" going forward where B.C. can see an increase in activities, travel and socialization in a safe way to prevent ""rapidly explosive growth"" as new cases arise.

""We are going to see more cases, and we know that,"" she said. ""We need to make sure that if we do get some spread, which we have seen and will continue to see, that we're able to prevent wide transmission to large groups of people.""

Henry said her approach in the coming months won't necessarily be to fully shut down parts of the province in response to outbreaks but instead work to limit spread while remaining open.

""This is going to be for the next coming months, but it's not forever, and we will get back to being together again in the way that we want to be together again — but not right now.""

Dr. Deena Hinshaw

Alberta's chief medical officer of health has faced major challenges during the pandemic after large outbreaks at meatpacking plants across the province led to a spike in cases early on.

The Cargill plant near High River in southern Alberta was the largest single coronavirus outbreak in North America and led to more than 1,500 people infected and several deaths.

The province managed to flatten its curve by mid-June, but a worrying rise in the number of cases this week has threatened to jeopardize Alberta's future.

As of Wednesday, the province had 1,251 active cases of COVID-19 — the highest total seen in more than two months.

""In some ways, we're a victim of our own success. We have controlled the spread in Alberta relatively well, which means that a lot of people haven't directly experienced the impact of having a loved one with COVID who's become very ill,"" Hinshaw said in a recent interview.

""I am concerned that people are perhaps relying too much on their own personal observations in their daily lives and feeling that this is something to not be too concerned about.""

WATCH | Dr. Deena Hinshaw warns of pandemic exhaustion:

Four months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Deena Hinshaw says officials are worried about COVID exhaustion leading to an increase in cases, the majority of which are Albertans under the age of 40. 2:19

Hinshaw said she's less worried about travel between provinces, despite reports of exposure to the coronavirus at house parties in B.C. involving Alberta residents, and is instead more concerned about individuals' actions.

""The challenge is about people really being tired of restrictions and wanting to move on,"" she said. ""Part of what we're seeing is somewhat linked to relaunch having perhaps given people a message that COVID is over — even though we haven't said that.""

Hinshaw said that while the danger of increased transmission from reopening further is top of mind, the alternative is that people will go underground to congregate in much riskier settings.

""It's really about convincing all of our population that they need to be taking these measures seriously,"" she said.

""We need to shift how we interact with each other to make sure that we don't get huge amounts of transmission and potentially overwhelm our health-care system.""

Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa's medical officer of health, says the city will need to remain 'vigilant' about outbreaks as Ontario continues to move into Stage 3 of reopening. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

Dr. Vera Etches

Ottawa's top doctor raised the alarm early about the possibility of COVID-19 infections going undetected in the community and the need to act quickly.

Only four days after Ottawa's first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on March 15, Etches told reporters she believed there were as many as 1,000 cases of coronavirus in the capital .

She's been described as having a "" will of steel "" and recently warned residents to be prepared to live with the risk of COVID-19 spreading in the community well into 2021 or even 2022.

Etches doesn't pull punches, but she still remains hopeful about the future.

""We have been able to progressively go back to more activities, and yet our case counts are stable or declining, our hospitalizations are declining, our deaths are declining,"" she said.

""So it really is the actions of individuals that has added up to breaking chains of transmission.""

WATCH | COVID-19 threat could be present in Ottawa for several years:

Vera Etches, Ottawa’s chief medical officer of health, says community transmission could continue into 2021 and 2022, with the virus rebounding periodically in either smaller or larger waves. 2:21

Ottawa has had just over 2,300 cases of COVID-19 and 263 deaths. Despite a recent spike in new daily cases, the city reported just 14 on Thursday.

Etches is confident Ottawa will be able to continue to maintain that level of control moving forward but is concerned about what she's seeing south of the border.

""It is the United States that is one of the most telling stories for us about the ever-present risk of a resurgence. People talk about a fall wave, but it could start in the summer,"" she said.

""We're opening up bars, I think it's fair to say that is one of the settings we know has had outbreaks in other places and so that is a risk.""

Etches said the city will need to remain ""vigilant"" about outbreaks as the province continues to move into Stage 3 of reopening.

""In the early days, before people started physically distancing, we saw case numbers double every three days and that could happen again,"" she said.

""I hope that people can take a look and see that the virus is still here. I think the language about a second wave as if it's gone, and it might come back, has undermined the reality that the virus is here and it will grow if we let down our guard.""

Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, says COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and even Canadian cities like Montreal linked to the reopening of bars are important lessons for Toronto. (Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press)

Dr. Eileen de Villa

Toronto's medical officer of health has guided Canada's largest city through the pandemic with cautious optimism, despite moving slower than other parts of the country.

But de Villa said the city has used that extra time to understand more about the spread of COVID-19 in order to stop it and prepare for reopening.

""We're fortunate in the sense that there are a number of other jurisdictions, cities and countries that are a little ahead of us in terms of their outbreaks, and so we have this opportunity to learn from their experiences,"" she said. ""If we want to keep our progress moving forward here in the City of Toronto, we need to be mindful of these experiences.""

De Villa said surges in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and even Canadian cities like Montreal linked to the reopening of bars are important lessons for Toronto, because people are in close contact and consuming alcohol and can be ""less careful"" about following public health guidelines.

But she admits she faces a ""balancing act"" with giving people a place to socialize safely while avoiding congregating indoors at places like house parties.

""We are social creatures as human beings, and there is an importance to having social connection through means other than just online,"" she said. ""There is a desire, and it's a very human desire, for in-person connection. The question is, how do we help people achieve that much-needed connection, but to do so safely?""

WATCH | Toronto's top doctor says physical distancing still needed:

Patios, salons, and indoor malls are now allowed to open in Toronto. The moves come as Toronto and neighbouring Peel Region enter phase two of reopening. But Toronto's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa says public health measures must still be followed. 11:40

De Villa said many of the U.S. states that have seen spikes in cases tied to bars and restaurants had not put in place strict physical distancing or masking measures before reopening and while case counts were still high.

Toronto has seen more than 15,000 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began, with over 1,100 deaths. That number has declined significantly in recent weeks, with just 24 cases reported on Thursday.

""If the level of COVID-19 activity in the community is low when you start to reopen and still do that reopening in a gradual and cautious fashion, it can be done safely,"" de Villa said. ""I do think it means that you need to be vigilant.""

Looking forward, the reality that Toronto could see a spike in COVID-19 cases isn't lost on her, but she's hopeful citizens will keep up their resolve as the city looks to reopening further.

""I think people are appreciating, as challenging as the circumstances are, that it does take all of us, and each one of us has to do our part and that we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain,"" she said.

""I do have a lot of faith in the people of Toronto. That doesn't mean perfection, right? As a mother of three, I can tell you that I don't look for perfection, I don't think we can expect perfection from anybody,"" she said.

""But I do try to look for the strengths that we see in our community and do what we can to build on those.""

25536,2020-07-25 4:00,"Amid unprecedented economic crisis, many Lebanese despair","Lebanon is hurting. And this time, say many Lebanese, who are no strangers to fortunes reversed, it's different.

""I have never seen people killing themselves because of the economic situation,"" said Elias Khalil, operations manager for a charity called Beit el Baraka where the number — and profile — of people seeking help has shifted dramatically in recent months.

Lebanon is in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis rooted in corruption and mismanagement that is redrawing the middle class and sending many tumbling below the poverty line.

""You can see moms, dads, who are educated, who used to have jobs, who never begged for anything,"" said Khalil. ""They are begging for a pot of milk or for the bag of rice just to feed their children, which is honestly devastating.""

One of Beit el Baraka's projects is a ""free supermarket"" in Beirut that uses a voucher system in an effort to offer people the dignity of still being able to make choices when shopping for their food.

'There is nothing in this country'

Fadia Marji is one of them, a well-dressed woman who looks to be in her 60s, waiting for a bag of carrots. She says that all four members of her household, including two siblings, have recently lost their jobs.

""There is nothing in this country,"" she said. ""No water, electricity or food. And with such crazy prices, living here is bad.""

The World Bank estimated in November that about a third of Lebanese people live in poverty, and warned that could climb to 50 per cent with a further decline in the economic situation.

Khalil says the number of people seeking help from the charity has more than doubled since Lebanon started its slide into crisis last fall, followed by COVID-19 and the lockdown that came with it this year.

Lebanon has always been a country of extremes — of vast wealth and great poverty, and of deep sectarian divides that have also at times allowed lines of compromise, making it possible for conservative and liberal cultures to co-exist in some fashion.

It's endured its own long civil war, regional conflicts including a 2006 war with Israel and the terrible blood-letting that has taken place next door in Syria and sent hundreds of thousands of refugees across the border over the past decade.

Somehow Lebanon has always seemed to find its way through to the other side. This time, people aren't so sure that will happen.

""Lebanon cannot muddle through this one,"" said Maha Yahya, of the Carnegie Middle East Center think-tank in Beirut. ""This country is in an exponential economic collapse which is happening at a very accelerated pace right now.""

Shortage of cash, electricity

Lockdown measures due to the pandemic have added to Lebanon's woes, but the seeds of the current crisis were planted long before, in complicated sectarian power-sharing agreements, endemic corruption and a government spending beyond its means.

A shortage of foreign cash reserves last October exposed what critics describe as a state-sponsored Ponzi scheme, with banks offering inflated interest rates to draw investment needed to pay off earlier investors.

""It's the bankers, the central bank and the politicians who, to my mind, were all in bed together and played the game together,"" said Yahya.

""They played a very high-risk-stakes game with the money of ordinary Lebanese.""

The Lebanese pound has lost nearly 80 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since October — a disaster in a country that relies heavily on imports.

Government-imposed capital controls mean people can't access their savings except by dribs and drabs, and inflation has soared. The price of sugar has tripled. Even baby diapers have become unaffordable for some.

""Even the people that have money don't have access to get their money from the banks,"" said Soha Zaaiter, executive manager of the Lebanese Food Bank, which supplies NGOs like Beit el Baraka across the country.

""So now we are depending on people abroad to help us or to send us donations.""

It doesn't end there. Lebanon's chronic power cuts have become even more chronic, with electricity sometimes out for 20 hours at a time, according to newspaper reports citing eyewitness accounts.

A popular cooking show has taken to tackling questions about how to preserve food when the fridge keeps going off.

And private hospitals are threatening to close their doors because they don't have the dollars needed to buy medicine or fuel to keep generators running.

""We have a huge problem of cash flow,"" said Suleiman Haroun, president of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals in Lebanon. ""We don't have enough money in our hands to run the day-to-day operations, and this has to be resolved -- otherwise, as we said previously, the hospitals are reaching a point where they will not be able to admit patients, only critical patients.""

'Lebanon is finished'

Not surprisingly, those who can are trying to leave, prompting fears of an exodus of people who just last fall were out on the streets demonstrating for change and reform.

Micheline Aoun and her husband Bruno Melki were among them.

They live in an apartment with spectacular views over the Beirut skyline and are well aware of their privilege, saying they are still able to manage. But they've made a decision to move to Canada if they can.

They started the immigration application process last year as an option for the future. Now it's a firm decision and they'll leave as soon as they're approved.

""I don't see any hopes in the near term, honestly,"" said Aoun, a former foreign exchange trader. ""Otherwise I would have stayed.""

Melki, a dentist with his own practice, calls Lebanon a failed state.

""We've been on this way for more than 30 years. Since I was a child, I always listen to my grandfather say 'Tomorrow it will be better.' My father used to say, 'You will see, tomorrow is going to be better.'""

Bruno Melki is a pediatric dentist who sees no future for his children in Lebanon. He says the family will leave as soon as their visas to Canada are issued. (Imad Abou Jaoudé/CBC)

It's a promise they'd like to make to their own two children — and keep. For them, that means leaving Lebanon.

""Everyone is thinking of emigrating,"" said Wissam Harb, an out-of-work musician who used to play at Beirut bars and restaurants that simply haven't been able to reopen amid coronavirus lockdown restrictions.

Now he busks on the street for his dinner.

""Lebanon is finished,"" he said. ""It is impossible that anything [will] change.""

Resistance to reforms

The International Monetary Fund has been in negotiations with the Lebanese government for weeks now, but insists that there can be no cash injection to help Lebanon without a tangible effort to root out corruption.

The European Union has delivered the same message.

""Unfortunately, the current political class is showing every resistance to carrying out the reforms needed,"" said Yahya. ""What they're doing to Lebanon is just criminal.""

Lebanon's post-war construct is based on an entrenched sectarianism — often dynastic in nature — with political positions and patronage power-shared between various religious sects including Christian groups, Druze and Shia and Sunni Muslims.

The offices of the president, prime minister and parliamentary speaker are traditionally held by a Maronite Christian, a Shia Muslim and a Sunni Muslim, in that order.

Complicating matters for Lebanon is the role of Hezbollah, the powerful Shia militant and political group backed by Iran, and on the list of proscribed terrorist organizations in a number of countries including Canada and the U.S.

Political analyst Makram Rabah has described Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah as having an ""ironclad grip"" over Lebanon that makes ""even the simplest matters overly complicated.""

Suleiman Haroun, president of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals in Lebanon, warns the ballooning costs to run private hospitals in Lebanon means many may soon have to shut their doors. (Imad Abou Jaoudé/CBC)

But he also says that plays into the hands of Lebanon's sectarian leaders by giving them an argument in favour of maintaining the status quo in order to preserve a fragile stability.

""Lebanon's current predicament can be partially credited to Hezbollah's hijacking of the Lebanese state and its spearheading of Iran's expansionist project in the region,"" he wrote in a recent article .

""But the crux of the problem lies in Lebanon's archaic political class that uses Hezbollah's weapons as a pretext to prevent and delay reforms that, if implemented, would strip the group of power.""

But if things continue on their current course toward a complete economic collapse, some worry that an even harder sectarianism will introduce itself, paving the way for further conflict.

""The [government leadership] fall-back option is 'Yeah, OK, we go back to our little sectarian enclaves,'"" said Yahya. ""So every kind of political party's kind of saying it would provide for its own people, and they are all building up stocks of food.""

Another worrying trend, she says, is a real clampdown on freedom of speech, with more journalists and activists being taken into custody over things published on social media.

Both Yahya and Zaaiter, of the Lebanese Food Bank, say they have been heartened by the activism of many people reaching out to help others in need during the crisis.

Soha Zaaiter says even those who have money can't access it, so Lebanese Food Bank are counting on donations and help from abroad to meet the high demand for food these days. (Imad Abou Jaoudé/CBC)

""A lot of small initiatives from university students, school students have contacted us to help, to offer their time to volunteer with us, and this is what made us proud,"" said Zaaiter.

But despite the sense of growing panic in the population and the force of those earlier anti-government protests, there is still a large absence in terms of a unifying force capable of lifting Lebanon out of its quagmire.

That leaves the leaders at the heart of the problem to resolve it.

""I think the leadership has a decision to make today,"" said Yahya.

""Either they privilege Lebanon over their own particular interests and recognize that they can only survive if Lebanon survives, or they continue what they're doing — which is pulling the country down the drain, pushing it off the precipice.""

For now, Lebanon remains a cry in the dark.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-unprecedented-economic-crisis-1.5661851?cmp=rss,news,world,

Send us your questions via email at COVID@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday on our website, and we're also putting some of your questions to the experts on the air during The National and on CBC News Network.

Gyms are open. But are they safe?

As restrictions continue to ease across the country, more gyms and fitness centres are opening their doors to Canadians who might be looking to lose their so-called quarantine fifteen .

But just because the gym is open, doesn't mean everyone is rushing back in. Flo C. wrote us to ask if fitness centres are safe, and how to handle mask-wearing when working out.

First, it's important to remember that gyms must adhere to their local public health guidelines for safety during the pandemic, but despite measures to reduce the spread of infection, experts say gyms still carry a real risk.

""[Gyms] are slightly higher risk because people are producing more droplets with the force of their breathing,"" said Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious disease physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. ""As opposed to a casual setting where you might just be having a conversation.""

GoodLife Fitness, one of Canada's largest fitness chains, says they're making their clubs safer by focusing on physical distancing, reduced capacity levels, and enhanced cleaning and sanitization practices.

With some exceptions, you'll also see staff and clients required to wear masks.

Wait. You mean I have to wear a mask the whole time?

Not necessarily.

Despite mandatory mask rules in some areas of the country, some cities, like Toronto and Calgary , have said you don't have to wear them indoors when you're ""engaging in athletic or fitness activity.""

GoodLife has also stated they are only requiring masks when exercise is not taking place. But you'll still have to wear one when ""entering and exiting the club and in change rooms, washrooms, and other common areas,"" said Jason Sheridan, senior vice-president of operations at GoodLife Fitness.

There is no danger in keeping your mask on the whole time, experts said, though it might not be comfortable at first.

Watch | Going to the gym during the pandemic: What to expect:

With more gyms and fitness facilities opening up across the country, The National’s Andrew Chang walks through what to expect if you go for a workout during the pandemic. 1:41

""We're obviously not used to a lot of mask wearing while working out,"" said Chagla. ""As long as the materials are breathable and people feel comfortable with them on, there shouldn't be an issue with wearing a mask at a gym.""

But pay attention to how you're feeling. As long as you're not feeling overwhelmed, short of breath or overheating, then Chagla said ""there's no medical reason why not to wear a mask at the gym.""

Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, agreed that it's safe to wear a mask while working out, unless you ""refuse to clean and it gets coated in bacteria.""

He acknowledged that not everyone will be able to tolerate the feeling.

""[The mask] impedes your breathing a little bit and different people may react to that differently,"" he said.

Furness suggests starting at a low intensity and building up from there. If you are feeling light headed, then slow down.

""People have not been into the gym in four months, so I think just lowering the intensity and working back up to it would be a good thing to do for your entire body, not just your breathing.""

As far as the type of masks you should use, make sure it's made of the most breathable fabric.

Both Furness and Chagla suggested cotton.

What about all that heavy breathing in my yoga class?

While working out with others may be motivating, group yoga or exercise classes can be really risky, especially ""in a room full of people where there's no ventilation,"" Furness warned.

""I would call that downright dangerous.""

A small room, large number of people, and poor ventilation all contribute to the increase in risk, Furness explained.

And make sure there are no large, plug-in fans turned on.

Watch | Why some Toronto businesses are betting improved ventilation will cut the risk of COVID-19:

The owner of United Boxing Club in Toronto's west end is already taking steps to cut the risk of infection inside his gym prior to opening his doors again. 2:43

""Moving air around the room is not only not helpful, but it's probably actively harmful,"" said Furness.

""If the fan is pushing air around, that two-metres no longer matters all that much.""

A safer workout would take place outside.

""There's no better ventilation than the good old outdoors,"" he said.

But if you still want to do indoor group fitness, Furness said you should look for classes with:

A very small number of participants.

A very large room.

Lots of ""air space"" and good ventilation.

Wearing masks in this environment should also be a given, said Furness.

""I would not walk into the room — let alone do a yoga class —if i didn't see everyone wearing a mask.""

Can I use the gym's sauna or steam room?

While the virus that causes COVID-19 doesn't do well in hot and humid conditions, Furness said that doesn't mean you can let your guard down in the sauna.

The benefits of heat and humidity are negated by the fact that you're sitting in an enclosed space, close to other people for a significant period of time.

Chagla said it doesn't really matter whether it's hot or cold if you're sitting close to someone with COVID-19.

Furness agreed, and said if it's a really small space, the droplets could probably go from someone else's mouth into your mouth ""very quickly"" before the virus could be deactivated by the heat.

If you're going for steam or a sauna, Furness recommends going alone, or with people in your bubble.

Is it safe to get massage and physiotherapy?

It's probably OK to get that kink worked on.

Services from registered massage therapists and physiotherapists are ""relatively low risk,"" said Furness.

""They have very clear directions from their regulated colleges about safety,"" said Furness, who's had both services since reopening.

""I trust them in terms of their protocols and because it's one-on-one.""

Most physiotherapy and massage therapy clinics have also made adjustments to the way they offer their services, including having fewer clients in their offices at the same time, stringent cleaning and a requirement to wear masks from both parties.

And of course, you should reschedule your appointment if you're not feeling well.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-questions-answered-fitness-saunas-1.5661709?cmp=rss,news,health,
25538,2020-07-25 4:00,COVID-19 comes to Coronation Street: How the world's longest-running soap is dealing with a global pandemic,"COVID-19 has been a difficult reality for months now, yet it's rarely reflected on television, aside from news programs. But now the virus has finally hit Coronation Street, the world's longest-running soap opera.

""It's an unprecedented time that we're living in, and I think it's absolutely right that Coronation Street reflects it,"" said Patti Clare, who describes the character she plays, Mary Taylor, as a bossy-boots.

""She has drawn up daily routines for them all to do. She's got them learning Italian online — she's got them singing out the window, "" Clare said.

Patti Clare, who plays Mary Taylor on Coronation Street, says her 'bossy boots' character is adjusting well to life in lockdown and has her neighbours singing out their windows. (Submitted by ITV)

Production on the British soap in Manchester was shut down on March 23 for nearly three months because of the virus. The show had a stockpile of unaired episodes and scaled back from airing six a week to three to ensure fans could keep getting a dose of ""Corrie"" during lockdown.

""Coronation Street is as part of the furniture as the Queen, or the weather report,"" said Clare.

The show played an especially important role during the pandemic, she said.

""When people have had the most terrible day, they put on Corrie, and they feel immediately comforted because they know exactly the lay of the land.""

Virus appears out of nowhere

On the first episode with COVID-19, which aired in the U.K. on Friday, the virus seemed to appear out of nowhere. Shop counters have hand sanitizer, posters promoting social distancing are plastered in Roy's Rolls café, and the virus enters plotlines.

Coronation Street character Adam Barlow, played by Sam Robertson, is shown during a visit to Roy's Rolls, where the bulletin board features public health signs and coronavirus warnings. (Submitted by ITV)

It's as if the characters had been dealing with it for months but previous episodes never even mentioned it.

The first COVID-19 episode will air in Canada on Aug. 17.

Some actors not yet allowed on set

Intimate and passionate scenes are a big part of soaps around the world, and they're coming up with creative solutions to keep the romance. In the U.S., The Bold and the Beautiful are using actor's real-life partners as body doubles to get around social distancing rules.

Corrie isn't going that route. Its writers are bringing passion to the show with words rather than kisses.

Production resumed on the show in early June with physical distancing rules on set. Cast and crew are required to stay two metres apart, and there's a person on staff with a stick to make sure they do. The number of people on set is limited to only essential cast and crew.

""Safety first,"" said show producer Iain MacLeod.

There are health checks for anyone entering the set and actors who are considered vulnerable — such as 88-year-old William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow — are not back to work yet.

Ryan Russell, who plays Michael Bailey, the eldest son of the first Black family to move onto the street, said he is constantly second-guessing himself.

Russell said acting is normally very physical but in this new world of physical distancing, he has to ignore his instincts at times.

""Should I move or should I not move? You do feel quite stationary at the moment, because you can't really roam around on set, like you do as an actor,"" he said.

Ryan Russell, who plays Michael Bailey on Coronation Street, said he is constantly second-guessing himself filming new physically distanced episodes of this show. His character's mother works is a nurse who will play a central role in upcoming episodes as she works on the front line of the COVID-19 fight. (Submitted by ITV)

""The staple of a good soap episode is a punch-up or a fight,"" MacLeod said. But right now, that's tricky to do because the cast can't touch each other.

To get around it, the crew are using creative editing, dummies or write the script so the fight scenes happen off screen.

""You might end one scene with an aggressor turning up and holding a pipe,"" MacLeod explained. ""Then the camera drifts into the alleyway and we find the victim badly beaten.""

'Humour will help resolve this conundrum'

The Bailey family will be directly impacted by the disease in the new episodes. Michael's mother works as a nurse. The show will explore the challenges and concerns the family has for her safety during the pandemic.

Other popular soaps in the U.K. and around the world, such as Emmerdale, have chosen not address the pandemic in its storylines.

""That will be very difficult, to be honest, to completely ignore the virus,"" said Carole O'Reilly, a senior lecturer in media and cultural studies at the University of Salford in Manchester.

O'Reilly said Coronation Street needs to strike the right balance when it comes to dealing with the virus. It has to take COVID-19 seriously but stick to its comedic sensibility.

""Humour will help resolve this conundrum about how much of the virus and how sick of the virus we all are,"" she said.

A lifelong Coronation Street fan, she rarely misses an episode. She said soaps are personal and emotional for viewers, but they are also important for neworks' bottom lines — which is why the show needs to get it right.

""They are big business,"" O'Reilly said. ""They're really key money-makers. For advertisers they are very important.""

Clare said her character will help people reflect on the humour that can be found in light moments of this pandemic.

""I hope they find some of it funny and I hope they laugh at Mary's homemade mask, which is pink with white ribbons — don't ask why.""

25539,2020-07-25 4:00,Latitudes and attitudes: How COVID-19 is impacting border towns in the West,"Latitudes and Attitudes is a collaboration between CBC Radio and NPR's Mountain West News Bureau that explores how the closure of the Canada-U.S. border is impacting towns that rely on tourists from the neighbouring country.

The Canada-U.S. border crossing south of Fernie, B.C., is quiet these days; there are no buses or vans packed with mountain bikes and vacationing families headed into the neighbouring country for summer fun.

The lack of international travel, due to the closure of the Canada-U.S. border amid the COVID-19 pandemic, has business owners who rely on tourism dollars from visitors crossing the border planning for the worst.

During any other summer, David Clarke, owner of the First & Last Chance Bar and Duty Free Store on the border brossing's U.S. side, said a lineup in either direction is the norm.

But lately, Clarke's store has been mostly empty.

""No traffic hardly at all,"" he said.

Paul Samycia started a river guiding company and fly shop in Fernie, B.C., two decades ago. More than two thirds of his clients are American.

With the border closed, he said the season is almost a writeoff.

""By the end of July we normally have about 220 trips under our belt,"" he said. ""This year, we are going to be lucky if we break 50.""

That's the story for many businesses in border towns that rely on tourists from out of country to bolster the economy on both sides of the international border. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some stark similarities, and vast differences, in attitudes among residents of Canadian and American border towns.

Businesses in Eureka, Montana rely on Canadian tourists to keep the economy afloat, and with the border closed, things are not going well. American public radio's Mountain West News Bureau teamed up with CBC to find out more. 3:42

The Canadian and U.S. governments agreed to shut down non-essential traffic between the countries on March 21. Earlier this month, that agreement was extended into August. And as COVID-19 cases continue to rise at staggering rates in some states, it's unclear when the border might re-open.

""Much of what we have experienced revolves around the anxiety of the unknown,"" said Gordon Sombrowski, who owns two hotels in Fernie and runs a third in Spokane, Wash.

With Canadians and Americans barred from visiting each other's countries for pleasure, Sombrowski is planning for the worst-case scenario — a closed border for up to two years. It would be devastating for Fernie's tourism-based economy, he said.

Similarly, Clarke worries about how his business will fare if the closure continues.

""All the revenue streams are down,"" Clarke said. ""The duty free is nonexistent and basically, what we put in the bank from the duty free gets us through the winter.""

Some businesses in Fernie, B.C., are struggling without the influx of American tourists that spend money in the town every summer. CBC's Bob Keating explains. 4:08

Despite the decrease in revenue for many businesses, Fernie mayor Ange Qualizza said local business owners she's spoken with don't want the border reopened until the United States has the pandemic under control.

The U.S. currently has the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the world, as well as the highest number of deaths. Washington state, which borders B.C., has recorded more than 50,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 1,400 deaths as of Wednesday. Montana, which borders B.C., Alberta, and Saskatchewan, has recorded far less — nearly 3,000 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in the state, as well as more than 40 deaths as of Wednesday.

""They don't want to put Canada or Fernie in harm's way,"" Qualizza said.

""They'd love to see their business model return; however, not at the expense of safety.""

South of the border, business owner LaVerna Munro agrees. Her gift shop in Eureka, Mont., has seen a 60 per cent decrease in earnings without Canadians spending money there, but she believes closing the border was the right thing to do.

""Our numbers are way higher than them, and I can understand where they don't want us up there,"" she said, referring to Canada.

Outbreaks of the novel coronavirus have hit much of the United States, yet in Canada the virus seems to be under control. Even so, attitudes toward the pandemic vary widely south of the border. Nate Hegyi of public radio's Mountain West News Bureau has more. 4:10

But there are people, primarily in the U.S., who believe the threat of the virus is overblown.

""What I've seen is an agenda being worked by the fearmongers,"" said Matthew Barrett, owner of Montana Shipping Depot.

Those fearmongers, he said, include everyone from liberal politicians to the media to the United States's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, he said.

Barrett makes the majority of his money through Canadians who ship packages to his business at a cheaper U.S. price and then cross the border to pick them up.

He estimates his revenues are down 90 per cent because of the border closure.

COVID-19 continues to impact communities around the world, and although British Columbia has kept case numbers relatively low, residents continue to follow the advice of public health professionals. CBC's Bob Keating asks Nelson residents how they feel about rules and regulations around preventing the spread of the virus. 4:04

The Centers for Disease Control has confirmed more than 143,000 deaths nationwide due to COVID-19. In Canada, just under 9,000 people have died from the virus so far.

As of Wednesday, B.C. had 3,362 cases of COVID-19 in the province, 285 of which were active. Residents of the province are not discouraged from travelling within B.C. anymore, and people from neighbouring Alberta are beginning to return for summer holidays.

But it isn't the same.

Jikke Gyorki, executive officer of Tourism Fernie, said visits are down between 10 and 20 per cent, which is about the percentage of American tourists that visit in a typical year.

""We'll see a U.S. visitor spend up to $600 per day, easily, per person,"" she said. ""Whereas a regional traveller will probably spend $150 to $200 a day.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/canada-us-border-closure-impacts-attitudes-1.5659175?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25540,2020-07-25 4:00,Electronic whistles a key way CEBL is adjusting to the COVID era,"Before the pandemic, train conductors, school principals and lifeguards were the most likely users of the electronic whistle.

Now the Fox40 product is selling at a record pace as pro sports leagues scramble to create a safer environment in the wake of COVID-19.

""We've had in the last two months communication from just about every major sport in the world,"" said Ron Foxcroft, Fox40 founder. ""And to be really honest with you, we can't keep the electronic whistle in stock right now for team sports because of the pandemic.""

The electronic whistle makes the same sound as a regular whistle, but it's triggered by pushing a button instead of blowing air, minimizing the prospect of airborne transmission of the virus.

The Canadian Elite Basketball League is among those pro sports adopting the whistle. Referees will be given their choice which to use.

Foxcroft is a former basketball referee. He officiated the Olympic gold-medal game in 1976 and spent time in NCAA's Division 1. The 75-year-old Hamilton, Ont., native currently serves as the NBA's game replay coordinator in Toronto.

Foxcroft came up with the pealess whistle — a whistle without that pea-sized ball in it — in 1987, and his company now manufactures product for the NBA, CFL, NFL, Olympics and more.

WATCH | The Breakdown: CEBL stars ready to hit the floor:

Fraser Valley Bandits player Marek Klassen talks about the excitement ahead of the CEBL Summer Series starting up. 3:54

The electronic whistle has been around for a decade. It makes the same noise as the pealess version — 120 decibels — but has been used by institutions such as schools, search-and-rescue police and rail transport because they can be issued to an intramural ref, for example, then taken back, sanitized and re-issued to someone else.

That holds obvious appeal during a pandemic.

Pro sports haven't adopted the electronic whistle because of the mechanical adjustment it requires for referees.

""Referees have to react, and it's quick, so rather than putting air into the whistle, they're putting their thumb on to the whistle,"" said Foxcroft.

Foxcroft expects some inadvertent whistles at the beginning of the experiment. Not that refs will garner much sympathy from fans.

""You know the best game you could referee is when you're fully concentrated, you have nothing else in your life. And I think we're gonna raise the level of concentration more in referees as they get used to the electronic whistle,"" said Foxcroft.

The CEBL has training in place for its officials to test out the new whistle before they determine which to use. Additionally, the league is offering its refs a whistle mask, also made by Fox40.

'It's going to look a lot different'

That change is just one of many the league is implementing for its Summer Series in St. Catharines, Ont., that begins Saturday. One thing refs won't be protected from is an angry player blowing hot air after a questionable call.

""Basketball is an emotional game and no one should expect that that could be managed in any way over and above how it's normally managed,"" said John Lashway, president of the CEBL's Hamilton Honey Badgers.

According to Lashway, the end product will look different on TV than any basketball before.

""We've got this whole arena ourselves. So we're going to spread out and it's going to look a lot different with the social distancing.""

The St. Catharine's Standard reported on Wednesday that five players tested positive, but were cleared to play since exposure to the virus occurred more than two weeks ago. The CEBL provided testing on Thursday, but won't for the remainder of the tournament, instead relying on public health centres.

Lashway says medical experts were relied upon in creating health protocols, and rules may be fluid as the tournament advances. The Niagara region moved into Stage 3 of its reopening on Friday.

WATCH | What is the Elam Ending?:

The CEBL Summer Series 2020 tips off on Saturday with a double-header on CBC. At 1:30 p.m. ET the Hamilton Honey Badgers take on the Niagara River Lions, followed by the Guelph Nighthawks and expansion Ottawa Blackjacks at 3:30 p.m. ET. 0:52

The Meridian Centre in St. Catharines has a 5,300-seat capacity which will be left unfilled. The league is bringing the minimum number of arena workers — enough that no one is working two jobs at once. The goal is to limit the amount of people inside the building as much as possible.

For TV viewers, that could lead to more natural sound. However, as was the case last season, music will be played throughout the entire game.

""People at home will hear sometimes, they'll hear the squeaks on the floor, but a lot of times they're going to get a little taste of the entertainment experience that makes the CEBL different than any other league,"" said Lashway.

WATCH | CEBL set for sophomore season on CBC:

The CEBL will be back in action this month, but they're using a new method to end games: the Elam Ending. So, what exactly does that mean? 2:45

The broadcast crew, who typically sit with their feet on the court, are being pushed back. The play-by-play person will be placed six feet apart from the colour analyst. Instead of reporting to the scorer's table as usual, refs will input play data at a table of their own.

There are four locker rooms, and with no more than four teams playing on a given day, each club will have its own space for the entirety of game day — before emptying out for overnight sanitization.

Players will be given individual baskets to store things like towels, water bottles, rosin and talcum powder. Those will be marked by numbers and kept by players at their bench –— which is also sanitized after every use.

Before a regular game, refs choose a ball that's used for the entire game. Now, the CEBL will swap in a new basketball each quarter.

""That's going to really inconvenience the players. The players are going to notice that,"" said Lashway.

Unsurprisingly then, players were not consulted on the CEBL's health protocols.

An adjustment to electronic whistles, should refs choose that route, won't be ideal either. Foxcroft said all these changes boil down to one principle.

""I just think now we have an option with the electronic whistle, because health and safety is paramount to everything we're doing today.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/cebl/cebl-summer-series-covid-precautions-electronic-whistle-1.5659684?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,cebl
25541,2020-07-25 4:00,"Oilers goalies Smith, Koskinen fuelled by friendly competition in pursuit of Cup run","Mike Smith's four kids – Aksel, Ajax, Nixon and Kingsley – will no doubt chuckle at their dad's response to a reporter asking what he plans to bring into the Edmonton bubble for the NHL post-season.

""Obviously a few pairs of underwear,"" the fiery netminder quipped on a Zoom call with reporters. ""I don't know if there's any laundry there or nothing, but I'm expecting to be there a long time.""

So long, in fact, that he hopes to be crowned a Stanley Cup champion on home ice at Rogers Place, albeit without the customary gathering of 18,437 spectators in attendance.

The performance of Smith – and that of fellow goalie Mikko Koskinen – is crucial to the Oilers' chances of authoring a fairy tale for their long-suffering fans. Edmonton opens the Stanley Cup qualifiers on Aug. 1 in a best-of-five play-in series against the Chicago Blackhawks.

""We've got a great deal of confidence in Mike and Mikko, and we'll continue to monitor through camp where each guy is at,"" head coach Dave Tippett said. ""But I envision both getting a chance to play.""

WATCH | CBC Sports' Rob Pizzo previews Oilers-Blackhawks:

In part 4 of 10, Rob Pizzo breaks down whether the Blackhawks could upset the Oilers. 1:05

The silver-haired among the Oiler faithful are accustomed to a goaltending platoon. Back in the dynasty years of the 1980s, Grant Fuhr and Andy Moog largely split playing time in the Edmonton net.

But come the playoffs, Glen Sather leaned towards the acrobatic Fuhr. All signs point to Tippett doing the same with Smith.

Tippett coached Smith in Dallas and Phoenix, so there's long-standing familiarity and trust. And then there's the experience factor. Through 24 career playoff games, Smith has posted a 2.17 goals-against average and .938 save percentage.

Koskinen's playoff experience? Zero games thus far.

""I think both guys want to play,"" Smith said. ""I'm preparing like I'm going to start Game 1, and I think Mikko is doing the same thing. We've had that mentality all season long, and I think it's made for a great, friendly, competitive battle in net.

""I think it's a big reason why this team has had success this year with both guys being able to play and contribute to the team's winning.""

In part 2 of 10, Rob Pizzo examines whether the defending champion Blues will come out of the round-robin with the #1 seed. 1:16

When on top of his game, Smith is a shutdown netminder. He effectively gives the Oilers an extra defenceman due to his exceptional puck-handling ability.

But there's a flip side. His tendency to roam can lead to pucks in his own net. He's streaky and, at age 38, nearing the end of his career.

Difficulty of playing without fans

There's also the question of how such an extroverted player will perform with no fans to provide fuel with their adoration and fury.

""It's going to be really strange,"" said Smith, who is an Edmonton folk hero, of sorts, after clobbering Calgary netminder Cam Talbot in a line brawl on Feb. 1. ""Whether they're booing or cheering for you, it's always nice to hear people in the stands and hear how excited they are to cheer for their team.

""It's obviously going to be a big adjustment not having that energy. We'll have to create our own energy as a group here.""

WATCH | Mike Smith fights Calgary's Cam Talbot:

In 38 games this season, Smith went 19-12-6 with a 2.95 goals against average and a save percentage of .902. The soft-spoken Koskinen (18-13-3) posted a 2.75 goals against average with a save percentage of .917.

""There's so much going on here,"" Koskinen said of playing in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""You just have to do your best and enjoy it.""

The Oilers will score goals for as long as their post-season journey lasts – that much is given with Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in the lineup.

Edmonton's fate hinges largely on Smith and Koskinen's success in keeping the puck out of the net.

""We have two different personalities but they mix well together,"" Smith said. ""Whether it's him or me, both guys are cheering for each other and we just want to do whatever we can to help this team win.

""We just want to get to the top and raise Lord Stanley.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/edmonton-oilers-goalies-mike-smith-mikko-koskinen-1.5661261?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
25550,2020-07-25 4:00,"6 months after Canada's 1st COVID-19 case, hospitals 'better prepared' to help sickest patients","By late March, COVID-19 patients had started trickling in to the already-bustling Brampton Civic Hospital.

One of them, a man in his 40s, had previously been healthy. Now, he was hooked up to oxygen, with a respiratory rate of around 40 breaths each minute — more than double the number an adult would normally take.

Critical care physician Dr. Brooks Fallis first met the man during a consultation, amid concerns the patient's lungs may be failing fast enough to require a transfer into the intensive care unit, or ICU.

""He was sort of the mirror image of me: Otherwise healthy, early 40s,"" Fallis recalls. ""That really struck home for me, that, wow, this is going to strike everybody.""

For many physicians leading teams in hospital ICUs, those first few months of the pandemic were marked by uncertainty, and tinged with fear.

News stories and photos kept flowing in from hospitals overseas, where clinical teams in virus hotbeds like Italy donned hazmat suits while scores of patients left in body bags. Anecdotes of what treatment strategies worked — and what didn't — were shared too, including early notions of rapid ventilation as a way to keep COVID-19 patients from suddenly crashing. On top of that, fears spiked that personal protective equipment was quickly running out.

But now, six months after Canada's first presumptive case, multiple clinicians who spoke to CBC News say their understanding of COVID-19 has evolved.

While the disease itself remains tough to treat, with questions still lingering over how it ravages the body, critical care teams dealing with the sickest patients feel better equipped to save more lives.

""Now that there are fewer unknowns, I think everyone feels better prepared,"" says Dr. Bram Rochwerg, a critical care lead at the Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton, Ont.

""There's less uncertainty around what to do.""

First case identified on Jan. 25

Back on Jan. 25, Ontario announced the country's first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 — then just known as an illness caused by a novel coronavirus — had been identified in Toronto.

Cases started to tick upwards after that, with roughly 40,000 confirmed cases across the province to date. At certain points in the pandemic, several hundred people were also in hospital ICUs at any given time.

Early on, the advice circulating around the medical community was to intubate those sick patients fast to get them hooked up to a mechanical ventilator — or risk watching their lung function suddenly plummet.

Fallis says the thinking has since changed.

""It's not that people can completely nosedive,"" he explains. ""There is a gradual deterioration, and some people can remain for a long time on high levels of oxygen, breathing on their own. Some people never need a ventilator and start to get better.""

Public health officials confirm the first ""presumptive"" case of the coronavirus in Toronto, but say the risk to Ontarians is still low. 2:24

COVID-19 does remain deadly for many people who fall seriously ill, often thanks to major inflammation and eventual lung failure that's known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS.

It's a condition long tied to other infections like severe pneumonia or sepsis, a major infection of the bloodstream.

Dr. Donna McRitchie, an intensive care specialist at North York General hospital and the facility's vice president of medical and academic affairs, says critical care teams are now shifting to more traditional methods of treating ARDS — not the rapid ventilation approach initially used for COVID-19 patients.

That means less rushing, and more watching and waiting to see how patients fare on oxygen treatments, and on hooking them up to a ventilator only when absolutely necessary.

""In a way,"" McRitchie says, ""the new standard is the old standard.""

Strategies 'buying time' for lungs to heal

For patients whose lung function does drop enough to require mechanical ventilation, many critical care specialists now agree that ""proning"" — flipping a patient onto their front for stretches of time — can help blood flow and oxygen intake.

Yet again, it's not a new concept, but one that does seem to benefit COVID-19 patients as well, Fallis says.

In the William Osler Health System, where he's medical director and division head of critical care, there is now a ""proning team"" to carry out the labour-intensive flips.

After a patient is intubated and using a ventilator, the team — usually two health-care workers on either side, one at the patient's feet coordinating, and one at their head making sure the breathing tube stays in place — carefully flip the person onto their front.

The patients spend at least 16 hours a day in that position, with staff turning their head left or right every two hours.

Some COVID-19 patients have an ""unbelievable response"" to the time-consuming positioning, which Fallis says helps boost their lung function, allowing clinical teams to use more gentle ventilation rather than higher settings that can do more harm than good to inflamed tissue.

""These things don't make the lungs better,"" he clarifies. ""It's buying time for the lungs to get better on their own.""

Steroid use as treatment now common

At the same time, clinicians are now watching closely for other impacts of the illness beyond the lungs, since it's now clear COVID-19 can wreak havoc on various areas of the body.

McRitchie says some seriously ill patients are experiencing everything from renal failure to constant blood clotting. The difference now is that physicians are actively searching for these ""potential complications,"" she adds.

""We've just never seen anything on this kind of level in our lifetime,"" stresses Fallis.

""When your lungs fail, your organ system becomes like a house of cards, where it can all fall apart. The more organ systems fail, the more likely you are to die.""

That's why so much hope is pinned on a successful treatment for the disease, beyond the interventions provided by critical care teams.

Dr. Rob Fowler, a critical care physician at Sunnybrook Hospital — the facility that treated the country's first confirmed case — says initially, clinicians really had no sense what, if any, medications would be effective against the disease.

While there's still no miracle drug to cure COVID-19, the physicians who spoke to CBC News all agreed dexamethasone — a steroid used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation — has been the most successful at reducing mortality rates.

As the World Health Organization noted back in June, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third for patients on ventilators, and by around one fifth for patients needing only oxygen support, according to preliminary findings from clinical trials in the United Kingdom.

""In a rather short period of time, we've gone from not having any idea of whether this was a valid treatment, to knowing this, in fact, would save a lot of lives,"" Fowler says.

Hospitals acting as 'safety net'

Overall, the changes in patient outcomes remain small, Rochwerg says, though clinicians do feel better prepared to treat seriously ill cases — thanks to a combination of tested strategies, and greater confidence in hospital protocols and access to protective gear.

In the case of steroids, which he says are now being used for upwards of 90 per cent of ventilated COVID-19 patients, they are medications that are relatively ""simple, cheap, and widely available"" compared to other treatments making headlines.

Fallis, whose teams are also giving dexamethasone to nearly all seriously ill COVID-19 patients on oxygen or a ventilator, also warns the disease itself remains just as deadly.

""If a large number of people get it, a large number of people will die,"" he stresses. ""Even with the best care.""

Looking back on his first experience with a COVID-19 patient in March, Fallis says that man in his 40s wound up not needing a ventilator. After a few days on oxygen, he was well enough to go home.

Those are the success stories physicians want more of — but more challenges lie ahead.

The focus this fall, Fallis says, amid more businesses reopening and students likely returning to school, is to stave off a second wave of cases in the community to make sure as few people as possible wind up in hospitals in the first place.

""We're here as the safety net for cases that do slip through,"" he adds, ""but there's no way the hospitals can take care of everyone who gets it if it runs wild.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/6-months-after-canada-s-1st-covid-19-case-hospitals-better-prepared-to-help-sickest-patients-1.5662338?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
25530,2020-07-24 22:51,Baseball is back as Biggio blast helps Blue Jays top Rays on opening night,"Cavan Biggio hit a three-run homer and the Toronto Blue Jays began their still-in-progress odyssey by topping the Tampa Bay Rays 6-4 Friday night in a season opener.

Earlier in the day, the Blue Jays announced they will play the majority of their home games at the stadium of their Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo, though it's not yet certain when the park will be ready.

The Blue Jays were blocked by the Canadian government from hosting this season because of coronavirus concerns, and hopes of shifting home games to Pittsburgh and Baltimore didn't pan out.

Biggio's infield single began a three-run fourth inning off 36-year-old Charlie Morton, who made his first career start on opening day. Randal Grichuk, Rowdy Tellez and Teoscar Hernandez drove in the runs.

Biggio, son of Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, homered in the fifth for a 6-1 lead.

Japanese slugger Yoshi Tsutsugo homered in his major league debut for the Rays. Tampa Bay signed him to a two-year, $12 million US deal after winning 96 games last season and making the playoffs for the first time in six years.

Morton (0-1), beginning his second year with the Rays, was a big part of the success in 2019 and an easy choice for his first opening night assignment after going 16-6 with a 3.05 ERA. The right-hander just wished fans, family and friends could have been in the stands at Tropicana Field to watch the start of the pandemic-delayed season.

Blue Jays starter Hyun Jin Ryu, second in NL Cy Young voting when he was with the Los Angeles Dodgers last season, allowed three runs and four hits in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out three, but also walked three before being replaced after throwing 97 pitches.

Jordan Romano (1-0) finished fifth and got the first two outs of the sixth to get the win. Rafael Dolis escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth and Ken Giles worked a scoreless ninth for the save.

The Rays set the tone for a memorable evening with an early morning tweet focused on social justice issues, stating as an organization: ""Today is Opening Day, which means it's a great day to arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor.""

Taylor was a 26-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed in her home by Louisville police in March.

Players from both teams took the field during pregame ceremonies — the Blue Jays lined up along the third base and left field foul line, with the Rays positioned up the first base and right field line — and held a 600-foot long piece of black cloth in solidarity.

25531,2020-07-24 22:38,"Oilers to honour Colby Cave with special jerseys, raise funds for charity","Emily Cave plans to have a special gift waiting for players when the Edmonton Oilers wrap up training camp.

Emily will be in attendance on Saturday when Edmonton concludes camp with an intrasquad scrimmage paying tribute to her late husband and Oilers forward Colby Cave, who died in April after suffering a brain bleed.

Emily won't be able to make direct contact with any of the players due to the physical distancing restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic. So she's decided to leave a personal letter and token of appreciation in their stalls to show her appreciation and support for the team.

""That's my way of thanking them for the support they've given, wish them good luck and let them know Colby is proud of his teammates and brothers, and we can't wait to cheer them on,"" Emily said Friday on a conference call.

""Only Connor [McDavid] and [coach] Dave Tippett know what it's going to be. It's nothing big or anything like that. It's just something special they can keep in their stall or that they can wear everyday.""

Saturday's scrimmage will see all players wearing Cave's No. 12, with the jerseys being auctioned at a later date to raise money for the Colby Cave Memorial Fund — a charity started in Colby's honour that will have funds go towards community programs, with an emphasis on mental health initiatives and providing access to sports for underprivileged children.

""We are so excited to go and watch the game tomorrow. I was in tears the other night and had a moment, it hit me that this was the last time I'd see No. 12 on the ice,"" said Emily.

'Meaningful game'

Oilers coach Dave Tippett is also excited for the scrimmage before his team opens up a best-of-five play-in series against the Chicago Blackhawks on Aug. 1.

""We just thought this game would pay respect to him and his family. I think the players are looking forward to it. They respected everything Colby brought to this team.

""They want to see [the charity] help people that Colby would have wanted to help. It's a very meaningful game for them.""

The 25-year-old Cave, from Battleford, Sask., died April 11 in a Toronto hospital while in a medically induced coma following surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.

He played 67 career NHL games for the Boston Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers. The centre was called up for 11 games by the Oilers last season.

Emily says the Colby Cave Memorial Fund will be a major part of her life moving forward.

""The first thing I said was this foundation will give me a purpose to get out of bed in the morning and it's going to keep Colby alive and his legacy alive.

25533,2020-07-24 22:18,"Police officers in deadly encounters should be required to talk, former SIU director says","A former director of Ontario's police watchdog is pushing back after a string of cases where officers involved in the deaths of civilians have chosen not to speak with investigators, saying the province has the power to make it mandatory for them to explain what went on in those fatal encounters.

Howard Morton, who served as the director of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) from 1992 to 1995, argues officers under investigation should be obligated to provide interviews and submit their notes to the unit.

He says their right to remain silent should be overridden by another element in Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms — ""reasonable limits"" under a ""free and democratic society.""

It's a legal argument but one Morton believes could transform police accountability in Ontario.

""In my view, that would be demonstrably justified ... because police officers are public servants who we allow to carry guns, who have some extraordinary powers,"" Morton told CBC News.

""They were on duty at the time the individual either died or was seriously hurt and they have an obligation to give their account.""

The comments come in the wake of the latest development in the case of Ejaz Choudry — a 62-year-old father of four in crisis fatally shot by police in Mississauga, Ont. last month — in which the officer who pulled the trigger exercised his legal right not to speak with investigators.

It's the most recent in a series of cases where Peel police officers under SIU investigation — referred to as ""subject officers"" — have declined interviews after fatal encounters involving Black people, or other people of colour, with mental illness, including Clive Mensah in November and D'Andre Campbell this past April.

Speaking to CBC News Thursday, the Choudry family's lawyer Nader Hasan called it ""troubling yet not surprising"" that the officer chose not to talk.

""There is nothing he could possibly say that could excuse or justify shooting Ejaz,"" Hasan said.

Choudry's nephew Hassan Choudhary also reacted to the news, saying on Twitter:

""Imagine having the right to pull a trigger on someone and not explain yourself. Imagine how my family feels... Today it could be my uncle, tomorrow it could be your brother, father, uncle or loved one.""

Officers 'entitled to their rights'

As it stands now, the SIU can only invite subject officers for interviews and can't compel them to participate or to submit their notes. That's unlike witnesses officers, who are required to do both.

On top of that, if a witness officer is found to have in fact played a role in an incident and is then deemed a subject officer, the SIU director must return all copies of interviews and notes to the force.

Howard Morton, who served as the director of the Special Investigations Unit from 1992 to 1995, argues subject officers should be obligated to provide interviews to the police watchdog agency, saying the province has the power to require them to do so. (CBC News)

During an SIU investigation, subject officers are treated essentially as suspects in a criminal investigation. As such, they share the same Charter rights as any other member of the public, including the right not to incriminate themselves, SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon said in a statement to CBC News.

Peel Regional Police had a similar response when asked about the recent examples where officers have declined to speak with investigators.

""Like all Canadians, police officers are entitled to their rights, which includes not having to speak with investigators if they are being investigated for a potential crime,"" said Peel police spokesperson Const. Akhil Mooken.

Interpretation of Charter 'not valid': ex-SIU director

But for Morton, ""that premise is based on an interpretation of the Charter of Rights which I think is not valid.""

""As public servants who are in the duty of serving and protecting,"" he argues police officers should be held to a higher standard.

CBC News asked Peel police what the repeated instances of officers opting out of interviews with investigators means for public trust. Mooken responded in part:

""While public perception can be affected when they hear that an officer has chosen not to speak with the SIU, it's important that the public realize that police officers are entitled to the same rights that all Canadians have.""

As for what the recent deaths of Mensah, Campbell and Choudry say about the force's handling of cases involving people of colour in crisis, Mooken said ethnicity and gender have ""no bearing"" when officers respond to a call.

He said their goal is to ""ensure the safey and well-being"" of both the individual in crisis and the community.

""Our officers constantly participate in training to ensure the person in distress receives the support they need,"" he said, adding the force is looking at the possibility of collaborating with other agencies with the aim of ""mitigating physical force and to determine if a police response is even required.""

Public has 'full and complete right to know'

Morton doesn't believe that any of one of the incidents tarnishes the Peel police force as a whole.

Instead, he calls the recent cases symptoms of something ""totally systemic."" He says he's in favour of removing police from the front lines and reallocating some of their funding to communities that are economically deprived.

""We have to redefine what the police are good at doing,"" he said, adding it should be mental health experts who first respond to calls for people in crisis.

Asked why the province has chosen to continue with its current legal interpretation and not require subject officer interviews, a spokesperson for Attorney General Doug Downey said the ministry could not ""provide legal analysis"" to members of the public or the media.

""In general, it is a well established principle in Canadian law that the subject of a criminal investigation cannot be compelled to answer questions posed by investigators conducting the investigation,"" said spokesperson Jenessa Crognali.

That's not enough for Morton.

""The public have a right a full and complete right to know what happened,"" he said.

""And if it leads to criminal charges against the officer, so be it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/police-siu-ontario-1.5661885,news,canada,toronto
25551,2020-07-24 22:15,"Search for Metro Vancouver's best neighbourhood: Grandview-Woodland, a home for urban Indigenous people","CBC Vancouver is highlighting different parts of the Metro Vancouver region as part of the search for Metro Vancouver's best neighbourhood.

You won't find an urban Indigenous neighbourhood in Vancouver like Chinatown, Little India or Little Italy.

But what you will find is Grandview-Woodland.

Indigenous people live in every suburb of Vancouver. But the Grandview-Woodland neighbourhood has one of the highest concentrations of Indigenous peoples. In fact, 2,300, or one in 12 of the area's 29,175 residents is Indigenous.

Affordability is now causing Indigenous residents, among others, to move away from the neighborhood. But the area's street art, community centre and schools continue to reflect a strong Indigenous presence, even drawing displaced families back to visit the place they consider their home.

Indigenous housing projects anchor a large number of Indigenous residents in the Grandview-Woodland area, Clark said. (WAWMEESH HAMILTON/CBC)

""We want to be here because our families are here, our people are here — the [Vancouver Aboriginal] Friendship Centre is here,"" said longtime Indigenous advocate Scott Clark, who's lived in Grandview-Woodland for 35 years. ""There's a lot of activities, arts and places for our folks, so it's been very welcoming for us.""

Indigenous origins

Grandview-Woodland is in East Vancouver and covers Burrard Inlet to Broadway Street and Nanaimo Street to Clark Drive. The area was a forest until it was logged in 1890, and the first house was built in 1891.

No records were found indicating when the first urban Indigenous people arrived in Vancouver. But one clue could be the federal Indian Act created in 1876, which undermined traditional First Nations authority. Clark posits that the exodus away from communities could have started then. Later, residential school survivors estranged from their homes often found themselves in Vancouver.

Clark's history in Grandview-Woodland dates back to the mid-1970s, when his mother moved Scott and his five siblings there from Victoria. Rent was cheap and Clark found fast company with like teens.

Indigenous elder Kat Norris says urban Indigenous people see themselves reflected in Grandview-Woodland's art, facilities and in each other. (WAWMEESH HAMILTON/CBC)

""There were a lot of impoverished Indigenous families that lived here then,"" he said. ""There was an element of crime and I hung around with other impoverished Indigenous kids.""

Grandview-Woodland is home to hubs of Indigenous activity. The Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre, Urban Native Youth Association and Britannia Community Centre, where Clark is on the board of directors, are hotbeds of Indigenous activity. And the neighbourhood has eight community parks, which are a surrogate for being out on the land.

But the biggest factor in the neighbourhood's large Indigenous population is Indigenous housing complexes. There are no fewer than 17 housing projects owned by Luma Native Housing and Vancouver Native Housing societies that are located in Grandview-Woodland.

""In the 1970s and 1980s when the feds and the province started building Indigenous housing, they chose to build in places with the lowest land value,"" Clark said. ""That contributed to the large number of Indigenous people here.""

It's our home

Indigenous elder Kat Norris has called Grandview-Woodland home since moving there from California in 1974.

Indigenous arts, culture and activism mostly happened in Grandview-Woodland, particularly after the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre moved to its current location from Broadway and Vine Street in 1979, she said.

Back then, urban Indigenous people were predominantly from B.C. and some from the prairies, Norris said. But that changed in 1976 when American Indian activist Leonard Peltier was brought to Vancouver to face trial for extradition to the United States.

Seeing our people and our art makes me feel like we belong and that I am home. - Kat Norris

""I noticed a lot of Indigenous people from the prairies came here to support him and many stayed afterward,"" she said.

A big reason Norris said she and other Indigenous people stay in Grandview-Woodland is identity.

""We see ourselves, we see our colour and we see our people,"" Norris said. ""When you go to Richmond or any of the other areas, you don't see yourself.""

When Norris travels from Vancouver to visit family, she has to ground herself in her Indigeneity when she returns.

""I have to go for a drive or a walk down Commercial Drive,"" she said. ""Seeing our people and our art makes me feel like we belong and that I am home.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/search-for-metro-vancouver-s-best-neighbourhood-grandview-woodland-a-home-for-urban-indigenous-people-1.5662633?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25528,2020-07-24 21:44,Raptors beat Rockets in 1st game since March NBA shutdown,"More than four months after COVID-19 shut down the NBA, the Toronto Raptors picked up where they left off — with a victory.

Serge Ibaka scored 18 points to lead the Raptors to a 94-83 win over the Houston Rockets on Friday in their first scrimmage at Walt Disney World.

Terence Davis added 15 points, while Pascal Siakam had 13, Norm Powell finished with 12, and Kyle Lowry chipped in with 11.

James Harden led Houston with 24 points, while Danuel House Jr., had 18 and Russell Westbrook finished with 10.

The Raptors hadn't played a game in 138 days, a 101-92 victory in Utah that came two days before the NBA shut down March 11 due to COVID-19. When the Raptors scattered for their respective homes to isolate, they were second in the Eastern Conference at 46-18, and had just clinched a playoff spot in a promising season that saw them win a franchise-record 15 games in a row.

On Friday night, in one of the three courts in the NBA's Disney ""bubble,"" the Raptors looked ready to resume their title defence, gathering strength as the game went on.

They trailed 75-74 to start a fourth quarter that was just 10 minutes rather than the regulation 12 to help players adjust to games after their unprecedented four-month layoff.

A Powell three-pointer capped a 7-0 Raptors run that put Toronto up by six with 7:17 to play.

When sharp-shooter Matt Thomas drained a three with just under three minutes to play, it gave the Raptors a 15-point lead and had Ibaka — who sat straddling a video board — celebrating on the sidelines.

The Raptors will have two more scrimmages — Sunday versus Portland and Tuesday against Phoenix — to regain their game legs before they open the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers.

Noticeable changes

Their first game in the coronavirus era was a stark reminder of how much the world has changed in less than five months. The stats crew was protected behind a wall of plexiglass. Coaches and players on the bench were spaced out over three rows. They wore masks. The stands were empty. The squeak of sneakers and the hollering of teammates provided the soundtrack.

The NBA is using the restart to amplify messages of racial and social injustice. ""Black Lives Matter"" was written in bold black letters across the court Friday. Nurse wore Black Lives Matter wristbands. The coach wore a shirt that said ""Vote"" for his pre-game Zoom conference with reporters.

Once the seeding-round begins, players have the choice to wear messages rather than their names on the backs of their jerseys.

Houston took an early 12-point lead Friday and led 29-22 to start the second.

Powell's layup midway through the second capped an 8-0 run to put Toronto ahead. Lowry banked in a three-pointer at the buzzer to send the teams into the halftime break tied at 49-49.

Marc Gasol, who missed 28 of the Raptors' 64 games this season with a hamstring injury, sat out the game.

The Rockets arrived in Florida without Harden and Westbrook. Harden arrived five days after his teammates citing family issues, while Westbrook had tested positive for the coronavirus and checked into Disney World earlier this week.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/toronto-raptors-houston-rockets-scrimmage-recap-1.5662713?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,nba
25527,2020-07-24 20:30,"Thompson, Werenski tied for lead at 3M Open as stars continue to fade","Michael Thompson and Richy Werenski topped the 3M Open leaderboard going onto the weekend, Tony Finau and Talor Gooch climbed within a stroke and stars Brooks Koepka and Tommy Fleetwood struggled again Friday.

In warmer and windier conditions on the quiet, spectator-free TPC Twin Cities course, the scores crept up after Werenski led the first-round pack with an 8-under 63. The 24-year-old, who's winless on the PGA Tour, followed up with a 67. Thompson caught him with a 66.

Koepka, at the other end of the board, was on the who's-who list of players to miss the cut. The four-time major champion shot a 71 to finish at 1 under, pulling a birdie putt attempt wide right on the 18th that would have extended his stay in Minnesota.

Fleetwood, playing in his first event since the virus outbreak shut down the sport more than four months ago, posted a 72 to finish at 1 over. Paul Casey had a second consecutive 72. Dustin Johnson withdrew after a back injury and a rough first round.

The exception was Finau, the only one of the five players in the top 30 of the latest world ranking whose performance matched his resume.

Finau, who had an eagle on No. 6, saved two of his four birdies for the final three holes. On the 18th, he stayed away from the water that Johnson hit three straight times on Thursday and produced a downwind approach shot out of the rough that landed on the green about 5 feet away. He sank the putt to finish with a 66 at 11-under.

""When you shoot two rounds in the 60, it doesn't matter how the conditions are playing. You know you're playing good golf,"" Finau said. ""It's been two really clean rounds for me. You can always build off that.""

Michael Gligic was the lone Canadian to make the cut, sitting at 2-under heading into the weekend. Canada's Roger Sloan, Aaron Crawford and David Hearn all missed.

Gooch, another tour upstart seeking his first career victory, posted a 65 to match Finau at 131. Xinjun Zhang is in fifth place at 10-under.

""Growing up in Oklahoma helps on these types of days, so I kept the ball low and kept it in the fairway, hit a bunch of greens,"" Gooch said.

'Weird' without fans

After playing in the afternoon on Thursday, the co-leaders benefited from a short turnaround. Thompson, who played in the first group of the day with a 6:50 a.m., moved even with Werenski on the 194-yard 17th hole. The 35-year-old Thompson, who has one career PGA Tour victory, landed his tee shot on the back of the green and then made a 20-foot putt for birdie.

""The big thing is just try not to overpower the golf course, stay within myself, make good, comfortable swings,"" Thompson said.

The good ones just didn't get any applause.

""It's weird. Obviously I wish fans were able to come out here, but I would say I'm almost kind of used to it now. It's been a few weeks of this,"" Werenski said.

Defending champion Matthew Wolff was 9 under after a 68 in a bid to match Daniel Berger with the rare feat of picking up his first two PGA Tour victories at the same tournament. Berger did so at the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis in 2016 and 2017.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/3m-open-friday-recap-1.5662537?cmp=rss,sports,golf,
25525,2020-07-24 19:07,"NFL training camps set to open on time as league, players agree on virus protocols","NFL training camps are set to open after the league and the players' union reached agreement on several issues, including future salary cap mechanisms and how players can opt out of the upcoming season because of the coronavirus.

The NFL Players Association's executive committee and 32 player representatives approved the offers Friday, two people with knowledge of the decisions told The Associated Press.

Players who decide they want to opt out have until Aug. 3 to do so, and they will receive a stipend from the owners, the people said on condition of anonymity because the offer has not been made public. The amount of the stipend will be $350,000 US for medical opt outs and $150,000 for voluntary opt outs.

That agreement eliminated one major obstacle to a full opening of training camps next week. Already, the sides had agreed to cancel all preseason games, as well as to a reduction in the number of roster spots in training camp from 90 to 80 — though teams will have until Aug. 16 to get down to 80.

The league also offered an extended acclimation period of 18 days for players, given that the coronavirus caused the cancellation of all off-season on-field activities at team facilities. Training camps are to open Tuesday, though the Texans and Chiefs, who meet in the season opener Sept. 10, have veterans scheduled to arrive this weekend for COVID-19 testing.

Many economic issues were settled, including how to handle revenue losses that would result from games played without fans or even cancelled games because of COVID-19. The league has proposed a minimum salary cap of $175 million for 2021; this season's cap is $198.2 million.

Should the 2021 salary cap decrease — a very likely outcome — caps through 2024 would be adjusted to cover some of that drop-off. That way, the cap wouldn't plummet too far.

The cap has increased exponentially since 2014, going up by $10 million or so annually.

Practice squads will be increased to 16 players if the league's proposal is accepted by the union, The Washington Post reported Friday. Four such players could be protected weekly from being exposed to other teams.

25524,2020-07-24 18:52,Hurricane Douglas bears down on Hawaii as pandemic flares,"The first hurricane to threaten the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic is presenting new challenges to Hawaii officials long accustomed to tropical storms.

For example, how do you secure enough shelter space when people have to stay at least 1.8 metres apart from one another? What happens when someone shows up at a shelter with a fever?

On Friday morning, Hurricane Douglas was 1,440 kilometres southeast of Hilo on the island of Hawaii. It was packing maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h, making it a Category 3 hurricane.

It's expected to weaken as it passes over cooler water, but meteorologists warn strong winds, heavy rainfall and dangerous surf could afflict the entire state beginning Saturday night.

Douglas is expected to be either a Category 1 hurricane or a strong tropical storm when it nears the eastern end of the state.

Record uptick in coronavirus cases

The storm approaches as Hawaii grapples with an increase in coronavirus numbers. On Friday, the state reported 60 newly confirmed cases, its highest single-day increase since the pandemic began.

""I never thought in 30 years of doing this I'd be answering medical questions,"" said John Cummings, the public information office for Honolulu Emergency Management, underscoring the odd position authorities have found themselves in.

Unlike other hurricane-prone states like Florida where residents pile into cars to evacuate when storms approach, it's impractical to leave Hawaii to get away from a storm. Shelter space is also limited.

There is a lot going on in the tropics right now. It can be a little confusing. We put together this map to show the current forecast cones for the three active storms<br><br>For more on...<br><br>Douglas:<a href=""https://t.co/fXA0uZtOWn"">https://t.co/fXA0uZtOWn</a><br><br>Hanna:<a href=""https://t.co/kZuKqfMuPV"">https://t.co/kZuKqfMuPV</a><br><br>Gonzalo:<a href=""https://t.co/LGeOIrRzeO"">https://t.co/LGeOIrRzeO</a> <a href=""https://t.co/MJpIS2VejP"">pic.twitter.com/MJpIS2VejP</a> —@NWS

So, as is typical, local authorities are urging most people to shelter at home if they can. Those living in homes built according to code after 1995 should be ""pretty good to go,"" Cummings said.

He recommended staying with friends and family if home isn't safe, advised people to seek refuge in an interior room and said going to a city-run shelter should be a last resort.

'We need more shelter space'

At shelters, evacuees will have their temperatures checked for signs they may be infected with the coronavirus.

People who have been quarantining themselves, either because they recently traveled to Hawaii from out of state or because they have been exposed to someone with the virus, may go to a shelter if their housing situation is unsafe.

Those with high temperatures or a travel history will either be isolated at that shelter or taken to a different site, Cummings said.

Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said that in a ""non-pandemic world"" the capital city on the island of Oahu prepares one square metre per person at shelters. But in order to have 1.8 metres of physical distancing between people, it must allow six square metres per person or family.

""We need more shelter space. And with more shelter space, we need more people to staff those shelters. And we're working on that right now,"" Caldwell said. The city plans to announce a list of shelters on Friday.

Hawaii leaders have been talking to the Federal Emergency Management Agency about potentially housing evacuees in hotels, but nothing concrete has been decided yet.

Caldwell said such an arrangement may not come together in time for Douglas's arrival but might be in place for the next storm.

Many of Hawaii's hotels have empty rooms or are completely closed because the pandemic has shut off most travel to the islands.

Some supplies going fast

State officials have been urging residents for months to incorporate hand sanitizer and face masks into their usual emergency kits containing two weeks worth of food, water, batteries and other supplies.

Caldwell urged people to get groceries for those who can't afford to go shopping for 14 days of food at once when so many residents are out of work because of the pandemic.

""It's the time to look at ourselves as one big ohana working with each other,"" Caldwell said, using the Hawaiian word for family.

In Hilo Thursday, Ace Hardware supervisor Adrian Sales reported a ""significant uptick"" in people seeking lanterns, propane and other supplies.

""We're out of the butane stoves already, and sandbags have been going, too,"" Sales said. ""It's a little hard to keep things on the shelves.""

Food shoppers have been slower to materialize at The Locavore Store in Hilo.

Owner Catarina Zaragoza predicted people will start buying up toilet paper and water if the storm looks threatening and gets closer.

""So many of our storms dissipate before they get here, so I think if we're going to see that kind of uptick it probably won't be till later in the weekend,"" she said.

People stocked up on supplies early on in the pandemic, but Zaragoza said she doubts that's the reason people weren't buying.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hurricane-douglas-hawaii-pandemic-1.5662542?cmp=rss,news,world,
25523,2020-07-24 18:43,Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen released from prison again,"U.S. President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer was released Friday after a judge ruled that he had been sent back to prison from home confinement as retaliation for his plan to release a book critical of Trump before November's election.

Michael Cohen walked out of a federal prison in New York on Friday afternoon, his lawyer Danya Perry told The Associated Press, a day after U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ruled that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was ordered back to prison on July 9.

Probation authorities said Cohen was sent back to prison because he refused to sign a form banning him from publishing the book or communicating with the media or public, Hellerstein said during a telephone conference.

""Mr. Cohen is extremely gratified that the court upheld his fundamental constitutional right to speak freely and publicly,"" his lawyer said in a statement on Friday following his release.

Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018 after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, among other crimes.

The campaign finance charges stemmed from his efforts to arrange payouts during the 2016 presidential race to keep the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from making public claims of extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.

Cohen was released to home confinement in his New York City apartment in May as authorities tried to slow the spread of the coronavirus in federal prisons. He arrived at the Manhattan apartment building at about 5:30 p.m. ET on Friday, declining to speak to reporters as he went inside.

Bureau of Prisons reject 'retaliatory' motive

Taking him back to the federal prison camp in Otisville, N.Y., earlier this month was clearly meant to punish him for his plan to publish his book, titled, Disloyal: The True Story of Michael Cohen, Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump, Hellerstein said.

""How can I take any other inference than that it's retaliatory?"" Hellerstein asked prosecutors, who insisted in court papers and again Thursday that Probation Department officers did not know about the book when they wrote a provision of home confinement that severely restricted Cohen's public communications.

""I've never seen such a clause in 21 years of being a judge and sentencing people and looking at terms of supervised release,"" the judge said. ""Why would the Bureau of Prisons ask for something like this ... unless there was a retaliatory purpose?""

Cohen, 53, had sued federal prison officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Monday, saying he was ordered back to prison because of the book.

The Bureau of Prisons responded after Hellerstein's ruling Thursday, saying any assertion that the reimprisonment of Cohen ""was a retaliatory action is patently false.""

It said the terms of his home confinement were determined by the U.S. Probation Office, which is run by the courts, rather than the bureau.

WATCH | Cohen calls Trump a 'con man':

In testimony over the course of seven hours, Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, characterized his former boss as a ""racist,"" a ""con man"" and a ""cheat."" But he also said he had no ""direct evidence"" that Trump or his aides colluded with Russia to get him elected, the primary question of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. 5:04

In a written declaration, Cohen said his book ""will provide graphic and unflattering details about the President's behaviour behind closed doors,"" including a description of anti-Semitic and ""virulently racist remarks"" against Black leaders including former U.S. president Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first Black president.

He said he worked openly on his manuscript until May at Otisville's prison library and discussed his book with prison officials. He said he was told in April that a lawyer for the Trump Organization, where he worked for a decade, was claiming Cohen was barred from publishing his book by a non-disclosure agreement. Cohen disputes that.

Prosecutors declined through a spokesperson to comment on Hellerstein's ruling. Perry had said in a previous statement that Hellerstein's order was ""a victory for the First Amendment"" and showed that the government cannot block a book critical of the president as a condition of release to home confinement.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/michael-cohen-released-again-trump-lawyer-1.5662598?cmp=rss,news,world,

""There is nothing he could possibly say that could excuse or justify shooting Ejaz,"" Hasan said.

Choudry's nephew Hassan Choudhary also reacted to the news, saying on Twitter:

""Imagine having the right to pull a trigger on someone and not explain yourself. Imagine how my family feels... Today it could be my uncle, tomorrow it could be your brother, father, uncle or loved one.""

Officers 'entitled to their rights'

As it stands now, the SIU can only invite subject officers for interviews and can't compel them to participate or to submit their notes. That's unlike witnesses officers, who are required to do both.

On top of that, if a witness officer is found to have in fact played a role in an incident and is then deemed a subject officer, the SIU director must return all copies of interviews and notes to the force.

Howard Morton, who served as the director of the Special Investigations Unit from 1992 to 1995, argues subject officers should be obligated to provide interviews to the police watchdog agency, saying the province has the power to require them to do so. (CBC News)

During an SIU investigation, subject officers are treated essentially as suspects in a criminal investigation. As such, they share the same Charter rights as any other member of the public, including the right not to incriminate themselves, SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon said in a statement to CBC News.

Peel Regional Police had a similar response when asked about the recent examples where officers have declined to speak with investigators.

""Like all Canadians, police officers are entitled to their rights, which includes not having to speak with investigators if they are being investigated for a potential crime,"" said Peel police spokesperson Const. Akhil Mooken.

Interpretation of Charter 'not valid': ex-SIU director

But for Morton, ""that premise is based on an interpretation of the Charter of Rights which I think is not valid.""

""As public servants who are in the duty of serving and protecting,"" he argues police officers should be held to a higher standard.

CBC News asked Peel police what the repeated instances of officers opting out of interviews with investigators means for public trust. Mooken responded in part:

""While public perception can be affected when they hear that an officer has chosen not to speak with the SIU, it's important that the public realize that police officers are entitled to the same rights that all Canadians have.""

As for what the recent deaths of Mensah, Campbell and Choudry say about the force's handling of cases involving people of colour in crisis, Mooken said ethnicity and gender have ""no bearing"" when officers respond to a call.

He said their goal is to ""ensure the safey and well-being"" of both the individual in crisis and the community.

""Our officers constantly participate in training to ensure the person in distress receives the support they need,"" he said, adding the force is looking at the possibility of collaborating with other agencies with the aim of ""mitigating physical force and to determine if a police response is even required.""

Public has 'full and complete right to know'

Morton doesn't believe that any of one of the incidents tarnishes the Peel police force as a whole.

Instead, he calls the recent cases symptoms of something ""totally systemic."" He says he's in favour of removing police from the front lines and reallocating some of their funding to communities that are economically deprived.

""We have to redefine what the police are good at doing,"" he said, adding it should be mental health experts who first respond to calls for people in crisis.

Asked why the province has chosen to continue with its current legal interpretation and not require subject officer interviews, a spokesperson for Attorney General Doug Downey said the ministry could not ""provide legal analysis"" to members of the public or the media.

""In general, it is a well established principle in Canadian law that the subject of a criminal investigation cannot be compelled to answer questions posed by investigators conducting the investigation,"" said spokesperson Jenessa Crognali.

That's not enough for Morton.

""The public have a right a full and complete right to know what happened,"" he said.

25520,2020-07-24 17:50,Supporters challenge Iroquois Nationals' exclusion from 2022 World Games,"The Iroquois Nationals, which represents the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in international field lacrosse, say they've been excluded from the upcoming World Games.

The eleventh edition of the World Games will be held in Birmingham, Alabama in July 2022 with 3,600 athletes from over 30 sports and 100 countries anticipated to take part.

""Our players, supports and staff are working tirelessly towards realizing your dream to play our game on the world's biggest stage. Every voice of support is welcome as we work toward the goal of bringing our game to the world,"" said Leo Nolan, executive director of the organization that oversees the team and its development group in a statement.

""This is more than a game — it's our heritage, our history, our medicine and our sovereignty.""

The Haudenosaunee — a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse. They call it a medicine game as a gift from the Creator, to be played for his enjoyment and for healing.

The Iroquois Nationals is recognized as a full member of World Lacrosse (formerly the Federation of International Lacrosse).

Qualifications for the World Games were based primarily on final placement in 2017 women's and 2018 men's World championships organized by World Lacrosse. The Iroquois Nationals are ranked third, but are not eligible to compete in the games.

In a statement published on Twitter, World Lacrosse stated that it ""doesn't determine the eligibility criteria"" for the World Games.

""Unfortunately, the Iroquois Nationals, as was the case in the 2017 World Games in Poland, do not meet the current eligibility criteria as established by the World Games,"" the statement said.

The International World Games Association didn't respond to a request for comment from CBC News.

More information on <a href=""https://twitter.com/TWG2022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@TWG2022</a> decision to NOT include Haudenosaunee athletes at the 2022 Birmingham Games<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IRQtoBHM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#IRQtoBHM</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QSU2Lf3wFy"">pic.twitter.com/QSU2Lf3wFy</a> —@IRQ_Nationals

It's not the first time the team's sovereignty came up as an issue competing in international competitions. In 2018, the Iroquois Nationals lacrosse team faced travel delays on their way to compete in the World Lacrosse Championships in Israel while travelling on Haudenosaunee Confederacy passports.

In 2010, they were denied entry into the United Kingdom based on their passports.

Lyle Thompson, a professional lacrosse player with the Georgia Swarm of the National Lacrosse League, has played with the Iroquois Nationals in a number of international competitions including the 2014 World Lacrosse Championship, the 2015 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship and the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship in Israel.

He took to Twitter this week to share his disappointment with the decision.

So they are essentially denying us our identity as a sovereign people. Again they are throwing our treaty’s in the trash. —@lyle4thompson

A petition circulating calling to support the team has garnered over 15,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon. The petition calls on other states to offer support and refuse to participate in the World Games. US Lacrosse issued a statement Friday.

""US Lacrosse stands in solidarity with the Iroquois Nationals, we extend our hand in offering to assist them and international governing bodies of sport to forge pathways that enable their inclusion, and we encourage the global lacrosse community to come together in support of our Haudenosaunee allies.""

25566,2020-07-24 17:46,"Wilfrid 'Dickie' Charlie remembered as skilled trapper, as court awaits sentence in his killing","A tearful Mario Skookum addressed a Whitehorse courtroom Friday, expressing remorse for his role in the 2017 stabbing death of Wilfred ""Dickie"" Charlie, a respected elder from Carmacks, Yukon, and Mario's cousin.

Mario was trembling as he faced the gallery and said he ""can't even imagine the pain"" he's caused the community, and his and Charlie's families.

""It's heartbreaking to hear the void [and] the separation between my relatives who were once so close,"" Mario said.

He added that he did not mean to cause Charlie any harm when he and his cousin, Tyler Skookum, went to Charlie's house looking for alcohol.

Mario said he plans to remain sober and make amends for what he did.

""I wish to do my best to help heal and honour my community,"" he said.

The man's mother called out to him as he was led from the courtroom. Justice Edith Campbell denied her request to address the court but gave her permission to speak to her son. The two shared a long hug, and she said ""I love you"" as he was taken away.

Campbell will meet with Crown and defence lawyers Aug. 4 to set a date to hand down a sentence in the case.

A cultural loss for the community

According to victim impact statements read into the court record Thursday, Charlie was a funny, popular elder who provided for his community and was a keeper of traditional knowledge.

Charlie lived off the land in the Northern Tutchone style and spoke the traditional language, said his sister Vera Charlie in a victim impact statement read in court.

He was an experienced hunter, trapper, fisher, and dog team runner, she said.

""It is extremely sad to say the dog mushing skills in my family [have] stopped because my brother was taken from me,"" Vera Charlie said.

Her brother always provided meat and fish, Vera said, adding that she struggles without his support.

""My freezer is empty,"" she said.

Other family members said they fear for their safety if Mario returns to Carmacks. Other members of Charlie's family provided victim impact statements but did not want them read in court.

Campbell said she would take the statements into consideration during sentencing.

Community victimized

Charlie's body was found in June 2017 near the confluence of the Pelly and Yukon rivers following a weeks-long search.

In April, Mario's cousin, Tyler, also pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case. Both cousins had previously been charged with first-degree murder for their joint role in Charlie's death.

The killing ""effectively placed the community as a whole in victim status,"" said a community impact statement that was also read in court.

Many of the people who were asked to contribute to the statement did not want to speak about the case, the document said. Some feared reprisals and felt pressure not to speak out.

There is much division in the community, and Charlie's death was also a huge cultural loss, the statement said.

The community impact statement, as well as most of the victim impact statements, will be sealed by court order.

Sentencing arguments

Crown lawyer Lauren Whyte said she's seeking a five-year sentence for Mario, who would receive two and a half years of credit for time served.

She said Mario poses a ""moderate"" risk to reoffend based on a history of violent offences and substance abuse.

""This is not Mr. Skookum's first violent offence,"" said Whyte. ""The sentence needs to deter Mr. Skookum from falling in again with substances and a negative peer group.""

But, Whyte said, Mario has shown remorse and undergone counselling.

Defence lawyer Bibhas Vaze says Mario did not intend to harm Charlie. Vaze argued Mario should be sentenced to one year, which would mean he would be immediately released because of time he has already served.

Vaze argued Mario should get a reduction in his sentence because the Crown was slow to disclose statements from two of Mario's relatives to the defence. Vaze said that is a major breach of Mario's charter rights.

""The Crown has to do better, and the court has to tell the Crown to do better,"" Vaze said.

The content of the statements is covered by a publication ban because they relate to other cases.

Crown lawyer Tom Lemon said ""there is absolutely no evidence"" the Crown intentionally withheld evidence in disclosure. He said the Crown immediately acknowledged the breach and supplied the defence with the information.

Lemon said the breach of Skookum's Charter rights should be worth a maximum of two months of his sentence.

Vaze also entered as evidence a letter of support from social service agencies that are willing to give Mario a place to stay and to provide him with substance abuse counselling.

The defence also entered examples of Skookum's artwork and writing, saying Skookum is committed to pursuing art and music upon his release.

Whyte objected to the inclusion of the examples. She said including artwork as evidence is ""highly unusual.""

Campbell ruled that including such works is no different than allowing certificates from training programs to be entered as evidence.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/family-remembers-wilfrid-dickie-charlie-during-sentencing-for-mario-skookum-1.5662370?cmp=rss,news,canada,north

25518,2020-07-24 17:25,Number of asylum claims filed in Canada rises slightly despite pandemic,"The number of asylum claims being filed in Canada continues to rise slightly despite ongoing global travel restrictions.

The latest figures from the Immigration Department show 1,500 claims for refugee status were filed in Canada in June, up from 1,400 in May.

For the first time since April — the first full month of major travel restrictions designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 — refugee claims were filed at airports. There were also multiple claims at marine ports.

Also slightly on the rise were the number of people stopped by the RCMP trying to cross irregularly into Canada: 32 in June, up from 21 in May.

Currently, Canada is turning back those who show up at unmarked border crossings — one of several measures being taken at the border in response to the pandemic.

Court says Canada-U.S. asylum agreement infringes Charter

How many people will continue to attempt to enter Canada irregularly may change in the coming months, in the wake of a Federal Court decision Wednesday that the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the U.S. violates the Charter of Rights.

The agreement is the reason just over 3,000 people this year have tried to cross irregularly into Canada in order to file for asylum.

Under the deal, they would be turned away at formal border points.

They can, however, still lodge a claim once they are inside Canada.

But Federal Court Justice Ann Marie McDonald said Wednesday that elements of the law underpinning the agreement violate the constitutional guarantee of life, liberty and security.

Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, which took effect in 2004, Canada and the U.S. recognize each other as safe places to seek protection.

That means Canada can turn away those who arrive at land ports of entry along the Canada-U.S. border on the basis that they must pursue asylum in the U.S., the country where they first arrived.

In the long-running court case, the applicants, who are citizens of El Salvador, Ethiopia and Syria, arrived at a Canadian land entry port from the U.S. and sought refugee protection but were refused.

They argued in court that when returning ineligible refugee claimants to the U.S., Canada exposes them to risks in the form of detention and other rights violations.

In her decision, McDonald concluded the consequences ineligible claimants may face upon their return to the U.S. are ""inconsistent with the spirit and objective"" of the refugee agreement and amount to a violation of the rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the charter.

The judgment was suspended for six months, however, to allow the government to find a solution.

Talks underway to update Safe Third Country Agreement

Talks between Canada and the U.S. to update the Safe Third Country Agreement have been underway for a while, and rights advocates in both countries have urged Canada to use the ruling as opportunity to push them forward.

""Human Rights First notes that the Trump administration's treatment of asylum seekers is now even worse than it was at the time evidence was submitted in this case,"" the non-partisan American group said in a statement.

""In light of the court's decision and this ongoing deterioration, Human Rights First urges the Canadian government to take this opportunity to withdraw from the 'safe third country' agreement.""'

The government can't sit on its hands and do nothing, said Queen's University professor and immigration law expert Sharry Aiken.

She said the agreement should be suspended immediately because, while the court was only dealing with the legality of the deal, it continues to affect refugee claims.

""In my view, the Canadian government has a responsibility to act immediately to prevent further violations of our Constitution and the international human rights commitments to which Canada has agreed to be bound,"" she said.

""It also means that it would be unconscionable for the government to appeal this ruling and seek a stay of the ruling.""

Current travel restrictions in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 appear to have placed downward pressure overall on asylum claims.

By the end of June 2019, 26,725 claims were filed, compared with 16,865 asylum claims filed so far this year.

The rise in June of this year was due to an increase in people already in Canada making claims at government offices, as opposed to those requesting asylum immediately upon arrival in Canada.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/asylum-claims-rise-june-1.5662157?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25521,2020-07-24 17:21,Hub city committee aims to ensure Manitoba sees return on investment from proposed CFL season,"The Manitoba government has set up a new volunteer committee to help oversee plans to host the 2020 Canadian Football League season in Winnipeg.

Earlier this week, the league proposed playing a pandemic-shortened 60-game season entirely in Winnipeg. The province of Manitoba committed $2.5 million in funding for the plan.

Ensuring the province sees a return on that investment will be one of the primary purposes of the new committee, which the province announced Friday.

The funding offer is dependent on public health officers signing off on the plan to make Winnipeg the hub city for the abbreviated 15-week season.

But whether the season will happen at all is still in question. The CFL's proposal depends on a collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players for the shortened season.

The league has also asked for $42.5 million in support from the federal government, but on Wednesday, Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said Sport Canada ""does not provide funding for profit-independent leagues or those outside of Football Canada's mandate.""

On Twitter, he later said that ""we are in fact in discussion with the CFL.""

The new hub city committee has been tasked with fostering community engagement and providing community oversight and support to the CFL and the Winnipeg Football Club during the season, if it goes ahead, the province said in a news release Friday.

""The committee will not be responsible for developing public health and safety protocols, which will continue to be created and enforced by public health officials,"" the province said in its release.

It will include 10 volunteer members from the community, including representatives from the local sports, business, academic, and health-care sectors.

Brock Bulbuck, executive chair of Boyd Group Services Inc., will serve as chair of the committee.

Other members include David Asper, acting dean of the faculty of law at the University of Manitoba; Obby Khan, a former Winnipeg Blue Bombers offensive lineman and owner of the city's Shawarma Khan restaurants; Payworks co-founder and CEO Barb Gamey; and Paul Robson, a former Blue Bombers general manager and former chair of the CFL.

The provincial government expects the season to generate $45 million in business sales, $4.5 million in direct tax and approximately $4 million in hotel stays, and to support 600 jobs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/cfl-hub-city-committee-winnipeg-1.5662530?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba

Morreale is the commissioner and CEO of the Canadian Elite Basketball League, which will tip off its refigured Summer Series on Saturday when the Niagara River Lions play the Hamilton Honey Badgers in St. Catharines, Ont.

It will be the first professional, non-exhibition team sports game held in the country since COVID-19 shut down leagues in mid-March — and it's been some heavy lifting for a league dealing with a global pandemic in just its second season of existence.

""It's going to be amazing for me personally. And then I'm going to say 'Please get to August 10th as fast as possible,""' laughed Morreale, the commissioner and CEO.

""I want it to start because we've worked so hard, and then I just want to get to the end and we can celebrate what we've been able to do. But I know it's not that easy. It's those 15 days in between.""

The league's seven teams have convened in St. Catharines for a 26-game competition that ends with the championship game on Aug. 9.

Morreale, who was a slotback in the CFL for 12 seasons, said he began to worry about the CEBL season about a week after the NBA shut down on March 11. It's been an exhausting four months of pivoting and refiguring amid the unpredictable coronavirus and its safety protocols.

""Every day has been crazy,"" he said. ""I keep thinking that the next day will be easier but nope. Not the case when you're in a pandemic, that's for sure.

""It's hard to put [the difficulty] into words, we've spent the last eight weeks in operational planning to get to the point where we could return, but at various points, if not almost all points along the way, there was never a clear indication that this thing is going to go, right?""

3 safe zones

The seven teams gathered in St. Catherines for training camp just over a week ago. Players and coaches have undergone several COVID-19 tests. While the NBA is in a contained ""bubble"" at Walt Disney World in hard-hit Florida, Ontario's Niagara Region has largely kept the coronavirus at bay.

There are three safe zones: the team hotel, the training arena, and the Meridian Centre, where games will be played in front of no fans. Players follow the same Ontario guidelines as the general public, meaning they can venture out to purchase groceries and other essentials, but family members and other outsiders aren't permitted into the safe zones.

Outside of the NBA, the seven squads feature a who's who of Canadian players including Justin Jackson, Owen Klassen, Duane Notice, Olu Famutimi, Grandy Glaze, Daniel Mullings, and brothers Phil and Thomas Scrubb.

""That's what this league is about . . . to give Canadian players and coaches opportunities to showcase their talent, and be home,"" said Charles Kissi, head coach of the Guelph Nighthawks, and Raptors 905 assistant coach. ""A lot of guys are playing overseas or in the States for the majority of the year and to be able to come home and play in front of their friends and family, or closer to home, and earn a living doing it, I think is pretty neat, it's a great opportunity for them.""

WATCH | CEBL's return to play plan:

The CEBL is the first league in Canada to start up again during the pandemic, but how did they do it? 1:29

Morreale said in terms of talent, ""when we hit the court starting Saturday there will be no better Canadian basketball talent anywhere than on the court for the next 15 days.""

In a global sports world reeling from the pandemic, he's proud to be able to give Canadians a place to play.

""They haven't played in four months, right? So this serves as not only an opportunity to get back onto the court and put a few bucks in your pocket, but also that really necessary game film for them to either continue their career or for the younger guys to start their career,"" he said. ""And then the exposure to the brand because we will theoretically be the only game in town in Canada.""

'I'm not scared to fail'

Working closely with Ontario health authorities, the three-week tournament is the culmination of ""eight weeks of every day just trying to push down another hurdle,"" he said.

""And before you knew it, we were in a position to say, 'Oh my goodness, I think we have a chance to pull this thing off.' I'm glad we can pave the way for not only other pro sports leagues but minor sports and amateur sport. How do those guys come back? So we can be almost the de-facto guinea pig.""

WATCH | What is the Elam Ending?

The CEBL will be back in action this month, but they're using a new method to end games: the Elam Ending. So, what exactly does that mean? 2:45

Morreale said he drew on his years as an athlete to push through the uncertainty.

""I'm not scared to fail,"" he said. ""And I think that has really helped me in the way I lead. Some people may have thought I was partly insane, but I also believe that we have the opportunity now when everyone is at home, and we have a captive audience and everybody's looking to see what's next . . . then we can move mountains.""

The Rattlers are joined in St. Catharines by the Nighthawks, River Lions, Honey Badgers, Fraser Valley Bandits, Edmonton Stingers, and the expansion Ottawa BlackJacks.

The Blue Jays finally have a home

Just hours before their season opener at Tampa Bay, the Jays announced they'll play the ""majority"" of their home games this season in Buffalo, N.Y. The team settled on Sahlen Field, which is the home of their triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons, after a potential deal to share the Baltimore Orioles' stadium fell through because public officials there didn't like it. Before that, an arrangement with the Pittsburgh Pirates collapsed for the same reason. And before that, the Canadian government decided not to allow the Jays to play in Toronto, which is why they needed a new home.

The reason the word ""majority"" was used is that Buffalo's stadium won't be ready to host the Jays' first home series, which is July 29-30 vs. Washington. Sahlen Field needs a few upgrades to make it major-league-ready — most importantly, better lighting. So the Jays and Nationals will play that series in Washington. It's possible the July 31-Aug. 2 series vs. Philadelphia could be played in Buffalo, but it seems more likely that the Jays will start playing there on Aug. 11, which is their next home game after that.

Sports escalated quickly

After months of pandemic-induced idleness, it suddenly feels like every league is back at once. Some are firing up their seasons this weekend, others are playing higher-stakes tournament games, and two big ones are making final preparations for their grand re-openings next week.

Here's what to look for on a sneakily jam-packed weekend for pro sports (feels good to say that again):

Basketball

The NBA season re-tips off in six days, and the Toronto Raptors play their first of three scrimmage games tonight at 7:30 p.m. ET vs. Houston in the Disney World bubble. The defending champs also have warmups Sunday vs. Portland and Tuesday vs. Phoenix. The regular season resumes Thursday night with a pair of games (including a marquee matchup between the Lakers and Clippers), and the Raptors open Saturday night vs. the Lakers.

But you don't have to wait that long for a hoops fix. The Canadian Elite Basketball League tips off its two-week-long championship tournament Saturday with a pair of games, followed by another two on Sunday. The Saturday openers (Niagara vs. Hamilton at 1:30 p.m. ET; Ottawa vs. Guelph at 3:50 p.m. ET) will be broadcast live on the CBC TV network and streamed live on CBCSports.ca, the CBC Sports app and CBC Gem. Sunday's games (Saskatchewan vs. Niagara at 1:30 p.m. ET; Edmonton vs. Fraser Valley at 4 p.m. ET) will be streamed. You can watch every game in the tournament live here.

The CEBL's Summer Series tournament is replacing the regular season and playoffs this year. It's taking place in St. Catharines, Ont., where the league's seven teams will compete in a round-robin from which the top six advance to the single-elimination stage. The top two teams get a bye to the semifinals, which are Saturday, Aug. 8. The championship final is the next day.

An interesting twist to the tournament is that the CEBL is using the Elam Ending for all its games. At the first stoppage in play with four minutes or less remaining in the final quarter, the game clock is turned off and the teams play to a target score. That number is determined by adding nine points to the leading team's score. For example: the ball goes out of bounds with 3:57 left and Niagara leading Hamilton 80-75. The teams now play to 89. So Niagara needs nine points to win the game, while Hamilton needs 14. The beauty of this system is that every game ends with someone sinking a basket (either from the floor or the free-throw line). There's no running out the clock by the leading team, and no intentionally fouling to get the ball back by the trailing team. Read more about the brilliance of the Elam Ending here and read 10 reasons to watch the CEBL tournament here.

It's also a big weekend for women's basketball. The WNBA tips off its shortened 22-game regular season (cut from 36) Saturday in its bubble setup in central Florida. It'll be followed by a standard playoff tournament that ends in October. Canadian national-team star Kia Nurse's New York Liberty play in the season opener Saturday afternoon. Read about how she's adjusting to life in the bubble here.

Soccer

The knockout round of the MLS is Back Tournament starts Saturday, and all three Canadian teams made it. Toronto FC won its group, while the Montreal Impact and the Vancouver Whitecaps both recovered from slow starts to improbably reach the round of 16. The tournament is single-elimination from here on in. Montreal faces Orlando on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. On Sunday, Toronto takes on New York City FC at 8:30 p.m. ET, and Vancouver meets Sporting Kansas City at 11 p.m. ET.

The National Women's Soccer League's championship final is Sunday at 12:30 p.m. ET. It's an unlikely matchup between the Houston Dash, who were seeded fourth for the knockout stage, and the sixth-seeded Chicago Red Stars. A new champion will be crowned after the North Carolina Courage, who won the title the last two years, were upset in the quarter-finals. Houston has four Canadian players: defender Allysha Chapman, midfielder Sophie Schmidt and forwards Nichelle Prince and Maegan Kelly. Chicago has only one — defender Bianca St. Georges, who scored her first professional goal in the Red Stars' 3-2 semifinal win over Sky Blue FC. Read NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird's thoughts on how the league was able to pull off its tournament during a pandemic and where she sees it going from here in this piece by CBC Sports' Signa Butler.

Sunday is also the final day of the English Premier League season, which restarted in mid-June. Liverpool clinched the league title about a month ago — its first in 30 years — but a few things are still at stake. Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester are battling for England's last two spots in next season's Champions League (Liverpool and Manchester City are already in). Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth are fighting to avoid the two remaining relegation spots (Norwich is already being demoted). Leicester striker Jamie Vardy is looking to clinch his first Golden Boot trophy for topping the league in scoring (he has a two-goal lead). It'll be a quick turnaround to the next EPL season, which kicks off Sept. 12.

Baseball

The shortened 60-game Major League Baseball season opened last night with the Yankees beating the World Series champion Nationals 4-1 in a game that was called in the sixth inning due to rain. Later, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are co-favourites with the Yankees to win the World Series, blasted San Francisco 8-1. Every other team opens today/tonight. The Jays face the Tampa Bay Rays at 6:40 p.m. ET.

Just before Dr. Anthony Fauci uncorked a ceremonial first pitch last night that was juuuuuuuuuuuust a bit outside, MLB and the players' union announced that they'd agreed to expand the post-season from 10 to 16 teams. The top two teams in each division plus two wild cards in each league get in. In the first round, the top seed in each league faces the No. 8 seed, 2 plays 7 and so on. Those series are best-of-three, and the higher seed hosts every game. That's followed by the usual best-of-five Division Series and the best-of-seven League Championship Series and World Series.

Hockey

NHL players arrive at their assigned bubbles (Edmonton for the Western Conference teams, Toronto for the East) on Sunday. Each team plays one exhibition game (Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday) before the so-called Stanley Cup Qualifiers (an additional round tacked onto the standard playoffs) begin next Saturday.

Last night, the NHL released more details about the bubbles. That included a lot of procedural items like how COVID-19 testing, hotel accommodations, meals, entertainment and off-ice fitness facilities will work for the players. But for fans, the most interesting stuff related to how the games will look and sound on TV without spectators in the arenas. In order to make the empty buildings a little more aesthetically pleasing, the lower-bowl seats will be covered with a tarp. Also, giant LED screens and banners will be placed behind the benches, displaying stuff like team logos and graphics and even video of cheering fans. Here's an artist's rendering:

(NHL)

Instead of the usual 20 TV cameras, 32 will be used to capture the games — some of them positioned in places they've never been before. Crowd sounds, supplied by the video-game company EA Sports, will be piped into the arenas so that players can hear them too. Unfortunately for anyone hoping to hear some of the, uh, colourful dialogue on the ice, games will be broadcast on a five-second delay so that anything obscene can be edited out.

25510,2020-07-24 16:17,"Law barring conditional sentences for some offences is unconstitutional, court rules","A law that bars a judge from imposing a conditional sentence for certain offences was struck down as unconstitutional on Friday in a decision likely to find its way to the country's top court.

In a 2-1 ruling, the Ontario Court of Appeal found the provisions of the Criminal Code run afoul of the the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because of their impact on Indigenous offenders.

""The impugned amendments deprive the court of an important means to redress systemic discrimination against Aboriginal people when considering an appropriate sanction,"" the court said. ""The reality is that the act will result in more Indigenous offenders serving their sentences in jail rather than in their communities.""

The decision came down in the case of Cheyenne Sharma, an Indigenous woman and mother of a small child who was caught in 2015 smuggling almost two kilograms of cocaine into Canada from South America.

Evidence indicated the first-time offender was in desperate financial straits and faced eviction from her home.

Case pitted Gladue principles against mandatory minimum sentence law

Because Sharma is of Ojibwa ancestry and a member of the Saugeen First Nation, the trial court took her background of trauma into account on sentencing as required by the Criminal Code since 1999 under the so-called ""Gladue principles"".

However, another part of the Code — enacted in 2012 by the former Conservative government under then-prime minister Stephen Harper — bars community-based sentences for offences such as drug-trafficking that carry maximum penalties of at least 10 years in prison.

Sharma challenged the provisions — along with another that called for a two-year mandatory minimum sentence — as an infringement of her constitutional rights.

In February 2018, then-Superior Court justice Casey Hill, who sentenced her to 17 months in custody, declared the mandatory minimum rule unconstitutional but dismissed Sharma's challenge to the ban on a conditional sentence.

Sharma appealed and various activist organizations intervened on her behalf. They argued that systems of discrimination based on gender, race, socioeconomic status and colonialism shape the experiences of Indigenous women.

Barring Indigenous people from conditional sentences as an alternative to prison time stops judges from fully applying the Gladue principles and denies offenders the full benefit, the groups said. The result, they argued, was that the provisions magnified the injustices the Gladue framework was intended to address.

The majority on the Appeal Court agreed.

""The impugned provisions, in their impact on Aboriginal offenders, including Ms. Sharma, create a distinction on the basis of race,"" Justice Kathryn Feldman said for the court. ""The provisions deny Ms. Sharma a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating and exacerbating her disadvantage as an Aboriginal person.""

Ruling a 'watershed moment': lawyer

Friday's ruling — which the court refused to put on hold — applies to all offenders.

""This is a watershed moment in the law,"" Sharma's lawyer Nader Hasan said. ""This decision will make sentencing more just for a significant number of people. It means that sentencing judges who want to dampen the effects of systemic discrimination will have another tool in their toolkit.""

The Appeal Court set aside Sharma's prison sentence, saying a conditional term of 24 months less a day would have been appropriate. However, given that she had already served her custodial time, the Appeal Court substituted a sentence of time served.

In a lengthy dissenting opinion, Justice Bradley Miller said he found no charter breach and would have upheld the provisions. Parliament, he said, had the right to mandate prison time for offences such as drug trafficking, regardless of who commits them.

""Parliament's legislative decision may be harsh. It may even be mistaken or unwise. But it is not ... discriminatory,"" Miller said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/gladue-sentence-unconstitutional-1.5662187?cmp=rss,news,politics,

25522,2020-07-24 14:56,Ontario premier considers mandatory testing for migrant farm workers,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford says his team has been asked to consult a constitutional lawyer to find out if the province can mandate COVID-19 testing for migrant farm workers.

""If someone comes into our country ... that's a privilege when you cross the border into someone's country,"" Ford told a new conference Friday. ""I tried to work — work until you can't work any longer — with the folks. I would like to look into mandatory testing.""

The announcement comes as Windsor-Essex's medical officer of health said the region now has the highest rate of coronavirus cases in the province.

On Friday, the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit reported 53 new cases of coronavirus, with 43 coming from the agri-farm sector. The number of migrant farm workers who have tested positive for coronavirus surpassed 1,000 Friday.

Ford said the province would foot the bill on ensuring migrant workers are cared for if they contract the virus, adding the ""least"" they can do in response is to get tested.

""If for any reason, they're sick, they're going to get paid. If they were here last year, they're going to get CERB. We're going to make sure we take care of them. We're going to feed them. We're going to put them in hotels — at our cost,"" said Ford.

He added that farm workers not being tested may hold Windsor-Essex back from advancing to Stage 3 of the province's reopening plan.

""We have to check the constitution. I've got to make sure I go through the lawyers. I have to make sure to call the federal government. But what's the problem to get a quick test? I've been tested a couple times.""

On Thursday, Ontario's chief medical officer of health said an on-farm testing effort had recently been paused after only 19 of 176 farms in the region participated.

Dr. David Williams said testing would restart with a new communications package created for farms and their workers.

Concerns raised over singling out migrant workers

Jenna Hennebry, associate professor with the International Migration Research Centre at Wilfrid Laurier University and co-founder of the Migrant Worker Health Expert Working Group, said she believes testing is essential and more of it is needed.

Henry said imposing mandatory testing on one group could single them out and send a bad message.

""It can breed xenophobia. It can create conditions where people don't understand that the risk isn't necessarily from those people — that, in fact, those people are at risk,"" said Hennebry.

""If the approach is to try to find the most effective public health approach, then it's about testing as many people as possible — not just a subgroup of people that are facing heightened vulnerabilities.""

Hennebry suggested COVID-19 testing should be mandatory for ""everybody that's entering the country"" and not just migrant workers who are ""not any more likely to have it than anyone else showing up at a border.""

She said the conditions in which the migrants work and live heightens their potential for exposure to the virus and for spreading it.

Hennebry added that testing multiple times throughout the season would be helpful, especially if it was facilitated by somebody other than employers.

In a statement, Migrant Workers Alliance For Change said Ford is ""back to blaming migrants,"" referring to the premier's statement earlier this month when he suggested migrant workers were hiding from COVID-19 testing. He later apologized.

""Unless testing is mandatory for all residents, including farm employers, this measure if implemented clearly targets low-waged, racialized people and is racist and discriminatory,"" read a statement from the group.

It added that the responsibility for COVID-19 outbreaks on farms ""lies with working and living conditions, not with workers.""

""Premier Ford knows how to fix this situation: He can mandate physical distancing at work and at home for all migrant farm workers and ensure equal rights for migrant workers. But he won't do it, and thousands continue to be infected, and three migrants are dead.""

Migrant Workers Alliance For Change said it is calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ""step in and give full and permanent immigration status to migrant workers so that they can protect themselves.""

Decision on Stage 2 regions advancing delayed

On Friday, Ford also said the remaining three regions in Stage 2 of the province's reopening plan — Windsor-Essex, Toronto and Peel — will have to wait until next Wednesday to find out if they can advance.

""I know the people are expecting to hear an update on Stage 3 reopening from us on Monday, but the health officials have asked for a little more time to analyze the numbers,"" said Ford. ""And I've always said we can't rush this.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ford-mandatory-testing-constitutional-lawyer-1.5662197?cmp=rss,news,canada,windsor
25513,2020-07-24 14:28,Indigenous leader hopes next premier will apologize to N.L. residential school survivors,"The president of the Nunatsiavut government wants the next premier of Newfoundland and Labrador to fulfil a commitment to apologize to residential school survivors — a promise the outgoing premier will leave unkept.

Johannes Lampe said Friday he wants provincial apology ceremonies held in several Inuit communities once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and large numbers of people can gather for public events.

""We are hopeful that the next premier will follow through on this important commitment so that those impacted by residential schools can somewhat find closure,"" he said.

""I'm hopeful this will be on the priority list of the next leader of the government of Newfoundland and Labrador.""

In November 2017, a day before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized to Newfoundland and Labrador residential school survivors on behalf of Canada, Premier Dwight Ball said the province would also offer an apology to former students and their families.

But on Thursday, the premier's office issued a press release saying Ball won't be able to offer the apology before he leaves office later this summer.

""I regret that I am not able to deliver a sincere and personal apology from me, as premier, on behalf of Newfoundland and Labrador,"" said Ball in the release.

""An apology cannot undo the harm and the suffering that residential school students and their families endured, but it is an important step in the healing process for Inuit who were separated at a young age from their families, communities, culture and traditions.""

The release said a plan to offer apologies in Labrador in March was derailed by restrictions on travel and public gatherings put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.

It also said there had been planning done for an apology this month but Indigenous leaders and the provincial government agreed it would be better want to until COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. The release also quoted Lampe as thanking Ball for ""making every effort"" to deliver the apology, and for understanding that all Labrador Inuit should be able to take part in any events related to it.

CBC News asked Ball for an interview Friday, in the wake of the media release announcing the apology would not happen before his time as premier came to an end.

A spokesperson for the premier's office said Ball wasn't available, but that he ""stands by the joint statement from the government of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Nunatsiavut government.""

Apology 'long overdue' — leadership candidate

Liberal leadership candidate John Abbott says he would be eager deliver an apology to residential school survivors if he becomes the next premier.

""It is fair to say that the apology is long overdue. Both the provincial government and the Nunatsiavut governments have been working on that. That work was started long before COVID, and it's unfortunate that it wasn't delivered before that,"" he said.

Abbott said he would be ""more than happy"" to deliver the apology.

""The apology has to be given as soon as possible and it has to be heartfelt.""

CBC Radio's Labrador Morning asked leadership candidate Andrey Furey for an interview on the issue. A campaign spokesperson did not immediately return requests. However, Furey is in Labrador, accompanied by Lake Melville MHA Perry Trimper. A person in Trimper's office told CBC that travel delays meant Furey could not accommodate an interview.

Residential school survivor frustrated

Toby Obed, a residential school survivor who helped start a class-action lawsuit that reached a $50-million settlement for about 1,000 residential school survivors in 2016, is angry Ball didn't make the apology long before COVID-19 restrictions were in place.

Labrador resident Toby Obed was removed from his home at the age of three and forced to attend a residential school. (Marc Robichaud/CBC)

""He just sat back and more or less just put it on the back burner. How ignorant and how rude and how dare him. He knew about this. I mean, this has just got me boiling,"" he said on the phone from his home in Hopedale.

On Thursday, one of the lawyers who represented the survivors in the class action also had strong words for the premier and the province.

""It is absolutely atrocious and the man should be ashamed. The province should be embarrassed.""

Lampe heard those comments but but said he's focusing on the future.

""I know the frustration and anger of Mr. Obed and Mr. Cooper but we as Nunatsiavut government, we still have to work together closely with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador,"" he said.

25506,2020-07-24 14:07,Global News lays off staff in 'significant' restructuring,"In what it describes as a ""significant"" restructuring, Global News is cutting some of its workforce.

The Canadian news organization owned by Corus Entertainment Inc. confirmed it has laid off staff in an email to The Canadian Press, but declined to provide exact numbers.

Corus executive vice-president of broadcast networks Troy Reeb attributed the layoffs to challenges faced by the news industry in recent years, including regulatory restraints, a lack of government support, advertising losses and most recently, COVID-19.

An internal memo Reeb sent to staff says significant changes will take place at the company's network digital operations in Toronto and that Globalnews.ca will no longer support lifestyle, entertainment and social media teams.

Reeb says this will help the company shift back to its core mission of providing breaking news and fact-based journalism, while emphasizing video over social media feeds that have lesser benefits for Global.

Reeb says the company has tried to delay layoffs and programming cuts for as long as possible, but in its most recent quarter advertising revenues declined and the company's news and radio businesses are 100 per cent dependent on such income sources.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/global-news-lay-offs-1.5662092?cmp=rss,news,entertainment,
25508,2020-07-24 14:01,Edmonton man recalls comforting victims of fatal tour bus rollover,"Ahad Saheem and his friend were taking pictures and drinking cold, clean water from the Athabasca Glacier in Jasper National Park when they heard a loud noise behind them.

A red-and-white sightseeing bus with giant tires, just like the one the Edmonton men had taken to the Columbia Icefield less than 15 minutes earlier last Saturday, had rolled down a rocky slope and landed on its roof.

""Our bus driver started running down the glacier and he told us that there had been an accident and we were stuck there for quite a while. He said that we cannot go back yet,"" said Saheem, 21.

The Columbia Icefield is one of the largest non-polar icefields in the world and one of the most popular attractions in the Canadian Rockies. It's about an hour's drive from the town of Jasper.

The driver told the group that paramedics were a long way away and asked if anyone could help.

So Saheem and his friend, Prankur Gaur, volunteered.

WATCH | Witnesses describe helping victims of Alberta tour bus crash:

Three people are dead and 24 injured after a glacier sight-seeing bus rolled over near the Columbia Icefield in Alberta's Jasper National Park. 1:25

Providing first aid, comfort

The pair walked about 500 metres down the mountain to the crash scene. They said people were lying all around, and some were badly injured.

""There were people with broken bones. There were people with spinal injuries.""

Gaur, a nursing student, was providing first aid to as many people as possible, Saheem said.

""My role was to comfort all the injured people, people who were in pain.""

Saheem said he recently joined the Army, but had not yet taken a first-aid course.

""Help is on the way,"" Saheem recalled telling the crash victims. ""Everything is going to be OK.""

Saheem brought water to first responders and collected people's belongings, including several shattered phones and cameras strewn about.

He said he helped some people who were well enough to walk back up the slope.

Three people died

Three people died in the crash, including Dionne Jocelyn Durocher, a 24-year-old woman from Canoe Narrows, Sask.; a 28-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 58-year-old man from India.

The other 24 people on board, including the driver, were injured, some critically.

Saheem described seeing a young couple on the ground.

""The girl was in his arms and the girl was really, really hurt ... she passed away in the guy's arms right in front of me,"" he said.

""We got a blanket and covered up her body.""

Devon Ernest was on the bus that crashed with Durocher, his girlfriend of two years. Ernest has described placing a sweater beneath Durocher and cuddling with her after he knew she was gone.

Saheem said he also saw the 58-year-old man who died.

""He was alive at first, and I was there, but EMS didn't arrive soon enough and he passed away, too.""

Cause of crash still unknown

The cause of the crash has not been determined, but RCMP said they have ruled out a rock slide.

Pursuit, the company that runs the Columbia Icefield tours, has said the buses don't have seatbelts because the vehicles are not approved to drive on the highway and don't go faster than 40 km/h.

Pursuit offers a Columbia Icefield Adventure, which it bills as a must-do experience in the Canadian Rockies. Guests board the big-wheeled off-road buses to drive onto the glacier, where they can get out to walk on the ice and fill their water bottles with the pure, cold runoff.

The company has said its buses have moved more than 16 million people, with no other major crashes since the vehicles started being used in the early 1980s.

Saheem said he and Gaur have talked about how they ended up on the bus they did, and not the one that crashed.

He said Gaur told him: ""Maybe God put us on that other bus just to go help out other people in need.""

25500,2020-07-24 13:44,"Moose Jaw police allege fired cop has decades-long history of misconduct including assaults, deception","The Moose Jaw Police Service (MJPS) fired officer Alan Murdock a year ago, alleging a list of offences that a police misconduct expert calls the most extensive he's ever seen in this country.

Murdock, a 29-year veteran of the MJPS, is appealing the dismissal.

In a six-page document filed with the Saskatchewan Police Commission, MJPS Chief Rick Bourassa lays out 25 allegations which include assaults, attempted fraud, inappropriate behaviour with a minor, habitually providing misleading information, unsafe storage of firearms and inappropriate physical contact with a female co-worker.

Murdock declined to be interviewed for this story, but in a brief phone conversation he told CBC News the allegations were ""false."" In Murdock's appeal application he says the chief's decision to fire him was ""excessive, unwarranted, unnecessary and inappropriate.""

Taylor Elder, the president of the Moose Jaw Police Association, said the union paid for independent legal counsel to review Murdock's dismissal.

""After thoughtful review and consultation with legal counsel, our members chose not to support Mr. Murdock in his appeal to be reinstated,"" Elder said via email.

Murdock does not have a lawyer. He is representing himself.

The case will be argued during a three-week hearing at the end of August.

'Why wasn't he fired many years ago?'

Tom Engel, a prominent Edmonton lawyer who specializes in police accountability issues, has reviewed the chief's allegations and Murdock's reply.

He said that by Canadian standards, this situation is extraordinary due to the quantity and scope of the allegations and the almost 30-year time frame.

""I don't know if I'd be able to remember a case as serious as this in Canada,"" Engel said.

He said that no matter where the truth lies in this dispute, it's not likely to end well for the MJPS.

If Murdock is found to be in the right and many of the allegations against him were trumped-up or embellished, Engel said, the tables could be turned on Bourassa.

""If these things are false and the chief knows it, he could be fired under the Police [Services] Act and could even be criminally charged with obstruction of justice,"" said Engel.

On the other hand, Engel said, if the allegations dating back years are proven, the obvious question is why the MJPS is just raising them now.

""I'm sure any citizen of Moose Jaw would have this question too,"" Engel said.

""Why wasn't he fired many years ago?""

The alleged offences are said to have occurred under the watch of three chiefs.

Terry Coleman was chief from 1997 until 2007, when he was appointed Deputy Minister of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing in the newly formed Saskatchewan Party government.

He told CBC News that he thinks he handled the discipline of Murdock in an appropriate manner. Although the list of allegations has not been tested before the hearing officer, Coleman says based on Bourassa's claims alone, ""I think I would have taken steps to dismiss him much earlier than what they did.""

Dale Larsen was chief of the MJPS from 2007 until 2013, when he was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice, Corrections and Policing. He is now Deputy Minister of Corrections and Policing.

A government spokesperson said via email it would be inappropriate for Larsen to comment.

Why no criminal charges?

According to a provincial court official, who conducted a search back to the early 1990s, it does not appear Murdock has been charged with any crime.

Engel wondered how that could be given all the allegations by the chief and the MJPS.

He said many of the chief's claims — such as assaults, theft, obstruction of justice, unsafe storage of a firearm and attempted fraud — would likely result in criminal charges if they were alleged against an ordinary citizen.

""If they believe [the order of dismissal] to be true, that means in many of these instances they have reasonable grounds to believe that criminal offences were committed,"" Engel said.

""Why didn't you charge this officer criminally?""

CBC News put that question to Bourassa.

""We are continuing to investigate,"" he said. ""I can't go any further than that because we just don't, never really speak about ongoing investigations.""

'Untrue information' in reports: chief

Engel said one allegation stands out as especially troubling, if true.

In his order of dismissal, the chief tells Murdock: ""You entered untrue information into your reports regarding incidents that you were involved in.""

When CBC News pressed the chief about what sorts of incidents he was referring to, he said they were ""in response to calls for service,"" though he wouldn't provide any further details or examples.

""We have done a number of reviews of all the information,"" Bourassa said. ""We have made notifications where we should have made notifications, and we are continuing some of those reviews and investigations.""

He said the MJPS is looking at ""what other impacts there may have been and what we have to do to correct those.""

Engel said while the chief is being vague, the issues he is raising could be very serious if the incidents involve members of the general public.

""There may be wrongful convictions that need to be fixed if this officer's credibility and reliability was a factor in a prosecution.""

'Inadequate investigation'

The issue of Murdock's conduct came to a head last year as police were sorting through a case of mistaken identity.

Brendan Olynik arrived back in Canada on Nov. 5, 2018, after a holiday in New Orleans.

He says as he went through customs at Toronto's Pearson Airport, border officers started questioning him repeatedly about his background and told him his name was associated with a crime in Saskatchewan.

""What the hell is going on here?"" Olynik, who at the time worked as a civilian analyst with the RCMP's forensic labs in Ottawa, remembered thinking.

He told the officers they might be confusing him with someone else and offered them his identification.

Brendan Olynik was shocked when Canada Border Services agents told him in Nov. 2018 that there was a Canada-wide warrant for his arrest. (LinkedIn)

""They said 'Nope. Your exact information matches up with a Saskatchewan-wide arrest warrant,'"" Olynik said.

""So I'm freaking out.""

The border agents let Olynik into the country but said he needed to clear the matter up. He contacted the MJPS and he says they quickly realized they made a mistake.

Olynik filed a complaint with Saskatchewan's Public Complaints Commission (PCC) which concluded Murdock had conducted an ""inadequate investigation"" of an assault.

""There was a failure within the MJPS to ensure the investigation the officer submitted requesting a warrant contained the necessary information and evidence,"" the PCC wrote to Olynik on July 9, 2019.

The assault investigation happened in April 2018. A complainant named the suspect as Brendan Olynik but wasn't specific about the spelling.

""Although there were persons with similar names on the MJPS database, the officer [Murdock] centred on your name for no discernible reason,"" the PCC found. ""Although the MJPS had you listed on reports as being employed by the RCMP, the officer did not attempt to make contact with you through the RCMP.""

Murdock was suspended on May 22, 2019, and put on a 12-month probation. Court records show Murdock consented to the remedial discipline.

The PCC also took Murdock's supervisor, who is not named in the report, to task for inadequate oversight of the file. Bourassa told CBC News he couldn't recall whether the supervisor was disciplined but that, ""the matter was addressed.""

Murdock fired

According to Bourassa, Murdock committed another infraction just over a week after that discipline was imposed.

In an affidavit, Bourassa said that on May 31, 2019, Murdock disobeyed a direct order to contain privacy breaches.

The chief alleges Murdock committed a second offence while on probation, on June 19, 2019.

According to Bourassa, Murdock ""provided misleading, false and inaccurate statements"" in an interview for an internal investigation into his misconduct.

The chief said that because of these two offences while on probation, he served Murdock with the order of dismissal that same day.

In his notice of appeal, Murdock said the MJPS failed to make any effort to offer treatment, training or coaching during his probation.

He also questioned the timing of his dismissal, coming just three minutes after the end of that June 19 interview.

Of 25 points on the dismissal order, the second one states: ""You did provide false information during an internal investigation on today's date.""

Engel also questions the timing of Murdock being served with such a lengthy document on the day of this alleged infraction.

Tom Engel, an Edmonton lawyer who specializes in police misconduct cases, says the list of allegations in the MJPS case is the longest he's ever seen in this country. (CBC)

""If they've already got the notice of dismissal written up except for that last item — number two — that's what's called pre-judgment or prejudice,"" said Engel. ""He went into the interview and they'd already decided they were going to fire him.""

The chief attempted to block Murdock's effort to appeal his dismissal.

The MJPS claimed that because Murdock was on probation when he was fired, he should be deemed a ""probationary member,"" which would mean he had no right of appeal.

The hearing officer dismissed the chief's arguments, allowing the appeal to proceed.

History of alleged misconduct

In his letter dismissing Murdock, Bourassa included a list of allegations dating back to 1998. Bourassa said Murdock had already been disciplined in some cases:

1998: Harassment of a private citizen.

1999: Unnecessary and excessive use of OC (pepper) spray.

2003: Inappropriate physical contact with female co-worker.

2012: Inappropriate text messages with a 15-year-old girl.

2012: Failing to properly store and dispose of exhibits including ""storing exhibits on personal computer and taking them home.""

Other allegations don't have specific dates attached to them. Murdoch has responded to many of these claims in his notice of appeal.

Allegation: ""You have subjected your step-children to physical assaults.""

Response: Murdock acknowledges that in 1997 there was an allegation he assaulted one of his step-sons but an investigation found the evidence couldn't establish that the spanking was unreasonable. He said there was an allegation in 2007 that he assaulted another step-son by ""putting the boy on the floor and holding him there for 30 seconds."" But he notes ""neither of these incidents resulted in police discipline charges or criminal charges.""

Allegation: ""You have engaged in inappropriate behaviour with a minor.""

Response: Murdock said this case involved a 15-year-old friend of his daughter's, indicating she sent him a text message in 2011. The details he describes are unclear but, ""he denies that he initiated any inappropriate contact or communication with a minor.""

Allegation: ""You did fail to return videos containing child pornography to the exhibit containment area.""

Response: Murdock said someone else moved the videos. He pointed out he had already been investigated and disciplined in 2012 for his handling of other exhibits. He said that discipline was expunged from his record by the chief in 2014.

Allegation: ""You did violate the provisions of the Local Authority Freedom of Information and Privacy Act by accessing other people's personal data without lawful purpose.""

Response: Murdock said a senior officer told him he may have violated the act. Murdock said he answered all questions honestly and took remedial training on his own time.

Allegation: ""You habitually provide misleading, false and inaccurate statements to interviewers in internal investigations.""

Response: Murdock said he has never intentionally provided false information, and if he had, it was inadvertent.

Allegation: ""You have subjected your female co-workers to inappropriate remarks and physical contact in the workplace and continue to do so.""

Response: Murdock acknowledges that in 1991 he kissed a female cleaning staff employee, stating ""he believed that this was something which they had mutually agreed to. He was told it was not acceptable, and the conduct was not repeated.""

Further, he acknowledged that a civilian employee of the police service was ""uncomfortable around him as a result of an inappropriate comment."" He said he apologized.

New allegations emerge

Bourassa said a series of new issues came to his attention after Murdock was fired. They were submitted as an amendment to the original order and include:

""You did remove or retain evidence in the form of drugs and alcohol.""

""You regularly stored your firearm in an unsafe manner.""

""You attempted to have an RCMP officer provide a fraudulent receipt for your own financial gain.""

""You were oppressive or abusive in conduct or language towards other members of the service including physical assaults of multiple members by means of 'bodychecks' and hitting members with objects.""

""You did, on more than one occasion, turn off the in-car video system, contrary to protocol.

""You did not follow proper procedure when dealing with victims of domestic assault and did discourage them from filing reports/statements or pursuing charges.""

As these allegations were filed more recently, Murdock has not yet filed his response to them.

Public inquiry required, Engel says

Engel says no matter what happens in the appeal hearing, this entire matter must go to a public inquiry.

""The curtain has to be pulled back on this aspect of how the Moose Jaw Police Service operates,"" he said.

He said this case raises many questions about how police handled Murdock's file, and he noted that Bourassa's and Murdock's versions of events are often ""diametrically opposed.""

He said it's unlikely all of the key issues will be aired in Murdock's upcoming hearing.

He said regardless of whether Bourasssa or Murdock is telling the truth, ""there has to be a public inquiry because the public needs to know how the oversight of police officers, how the accountability of police officers for misconduct is handled by their police service.""

If the allegations against Murdock are sustained, he said, this will not be a story about ""one bad apple.""

""He's surrounded by bad apples who do nothing, who have done nothing, to stop it. And they're part of the problem,"" said Engel. ""It's a systemic problem in this police service.""

He said this story is all too familiar in Canadian policing.

""There are crimes committed by officers and nothing is done about it except for maybe a slap on the wrist,"" he said.

""[Police services] have this misguided belief that if they sweep it under the carpet, that will protect their reputation — when it's exactly the opposite,"" said Engel.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/alan-murdock-dismissal-order-allegations-1.5660991?cmp=rss,news,canada,saskatchewan
25498,2020-07-24 13:29,Health experts ask Ottawa to make a decision on funding domestic COVID-19 vaccine trial,"The Trudeau government is being pressed to approve funding for a made-in-Canada COVID-19 vaccine to lessen the risk Canadians will have to line up and wait on a foreign-made pandemic cure.

For instance, health-care professionals have written to Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains to urge him make up his mind on a proposal submitted in April by Providence Therapeutics of Toronto.

The company is seeking $35 million to establish whether its vaccine is effective in humans after successful animal trials.

They say Canada has no guarantee it will be at the front of the line for any internationally produced pandemic cure. They attribute government's slowness to a long-standing public policy problem: a reluctance to partner with pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the same way it has tried to bolster other sectors.

""When you're dealing with a pandemic like this and the government has already spent millions of dollars on all sorts of things, an additional investment into another vaccine technology, to increase our shots on goal in Canada, to help ensure that we actually develop the best vaccine, the most efficacious vaccine, I think to me makes sense,"" said Laszlo Radvanyi, president and scientific director of the publicly funded Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.

The federal government has created a $600-million fund to support vaccine clinical trials and manufacturing inside Canada.

Providence has told the government it could deliver five million doses of its new mRNA vaccine by mid-2021 for use in Canada if it's able to successfully complete human testing.

The mRNA technology is new and untested but experts say it has potential.

Radvanyi and others say the research deserves support because there are troubling signs that Canadians might have wait to receive a vaccine that is invented abroad.

Canadian-Chinese vaccine partnership on the rocks

Canada already has invested in a vaccine-development partnership between China's CanSino Biologics and Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia but China has held up shipments it was supposed to send to Dalhousie researchers by the end of May to start human trials.

Canada-China relations are severely strained after the People's Republic imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant in December 2018.

""This should have been flagged as an obstacle when contemplating doing this program. We're not on the best of terms with the Chinese government,"" said Radvanyi, who has collaborated with Providence on vaccine treatments for cancer and wrote to Bains to support the company.

Chinese vaccine maker CanSino Biologics' sign is pictured on its building in Tianjin, China November 20, 2018. (Reuters)

He also stressed that his support is based purely on the merits of the science behind the proposal.

""With any new technology, one needs to be careful not to drink the Kool-Aid and let the data and the science speak for itself. But clearly there are really promising data emerging from new mRNA vaccine tests, including from the American company Moderna Inc. and the German firm BioNTech SE,"" said Radvanyi.

Both those companies have been heavily funded through U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Operation Warp Speed"" program to fast-track a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.

This week the U.S. committed to pay BioNTech and its American partner Pfizer $1.95 billion to produce 100 million doses if their vaccine candidate proves safe and effective in humans. In April, the U.S. agreed to pay Moderna up to $483 million to fund its research. Next week, Moderna is set to launch a 30,000-person final round of testing to test the strength of its vaccine candidate.

Feds mum on Providence vaccine proposal, CEO says

Providence's chief executive Brad Sorenson said he has heard ""crickets"" from Ottawa since late May after his company submitted its proposal in April — and after the government reached out to it as a possible vaccine-maker.

""We need a Canadian solution, a manufacturing solution in Canada. All of our (intellectual property), all of our manufacturing, all of the work we are doing is inside Canada,"" said Sorenson.

""We're ready to manufacture.""

The company wants to move forward with human trials because it has generated neutralizing antibodies in animals, with the same technology that BioNTech and Moderna have used, said Sorenson.

""And we're paused. We're waiting,"" he said.

""We had identified space to do a manufacturing run for our vaccine in September. We've lost that space now because we didn't get any support, and we couldn't hold it indefinitely.

""The next opportunity for us to manufacture would be late October, early November. So literally, we're ready to do it. We just need the co-operation.""

Bains' spokesperson John Power said he couldn't comment on specific proposals.

""A number of applications have been received and they are being assessed for funding considerations. The evaluation process is ongoing, and we will not comment on the status of individual applications,"" he said in an emailed response to a series of questions.

Made-in-Canada vaccine should be a priority: experts

Brad Wouters, executive vice-president of science and research at Toronto's University Health Network, said the time has come for Canada to ""hedge"" its bets and support Providence, given the hold-up of the Chinese shipment.

""This, to me, is sort of a no-brainer to give these guys a shot, especially with the promising data coming out of the U.S. and other places,"" said Wouters, who also wrote to Bains asking him to support Providence.

The new mRNA technology departs from how vaccines traditionally have been made to counter the flu or polio, for example. The traditional approach involves taking some of the actual virus, rendering it safe or inactive and then injecting it into the human body to create an immune response.

Instead, the mRNA approach involves injecting a key fragment of genetic material from the virus so the human body can produce the viral proteins needed to mount an immune response, said Wouters.

One advantage of mRNA vaccines is they're relatively inexpensive to produce, said Tania Watts, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto, who is conducting a study on how long immunity to COVID-19 lasts in people who have recovered from infections.

""They're chemically made so you don't need to have live virus and you don't have to grow cells. The first trials from Moderna look like two doses gave really great antibody responses,"" she said.

But Watts said more research is needed to establish how effective the new vaccines are.

Watts said the government should back a made-in-Canada vaccine because China, and even the U.S., can't be relied upon to share one.

She also said that multiple vaccines in multiple doses is the likely end-game scenario for the pandemic.

""We don't know if vaccines made outside Canada are going to be available to us,"" said Watts. ""If you were the U.S., you'd probably want to make sure that your own supply was secured first.""

Radvanyi said the COVID-19 vaccine race has exposed the government's flawed approach to collaborating with a private sector driven by profit motives, and it must now do more to foster a regime that can deliver affordable drugs to Canadian consumers.

He urged the government to create an advisory body of scientists and clinicians to survey and review the best technology and vaccine approaches to deal with the current crisis and future pandemics.

""There has to be a motive to make money to sustain operations, but through a public-private partnership the government can help drive a new paradigm in terms of drug development and manufacturing.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/health-experts-domestic-vaccine-1.5661857?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25499,2020-07-24 13:23,Meng Wanzhou lawyers claim Trump has 'poisoned' extradition proceedings,"Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou claim U.S. President Donald Trump has ""poisoned"" extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive to the degree where the judge overseeing the hearing has no choice but to throw the case out.

In court documents filed in advance of a September hearing, Meng's defence team cites Trump's history of intervening in high-profile criminal cases to claim he would have no hesitation to make good on his threat to use their client as a bargaining chip in a global trade war.

Lawyers for the Huawei chief financial officer also noted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comments about two Canadians detained in China in apparent retaliation for Meng's arrest.

The lawyers claim Meng, 48, has been left in the impossible position of fearing that any attempt to defend herself may affect either the Chinese economy or the lives of two men.

""These proceedings have been poisoned,"" Meng's lawyers claimed in a 28-page legal brief outlining their arguments.

""They can no longer be reasonably regarded as fair, regardless of the undoubted good faith of the court.""

Trump says he would 'certainly intervene'

Meng was arrested on an extradition warrant on Dec. 1, 2018, after landing in Vancouver on what was supposed to be a layover between Hong Kong and Mexico City.

The U.S. wants to extradite Meng to New York to face charges of fraud and conspiracy.

She is accused of lying to banks about Huawei's relationship with a company accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Prosecutors claim Meng's alleged lies placed banks at risk of loss and prosecution.

Lawyers for Meng, seen arriving at court earlier this year, say the proceedings should be ended. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press)

The latest legal arguments are grounded in a statement Trump made to a reporter less than two weeks after Meng's arrest in which he was asked if he would intervene in the case. At the time, the United States had recently escalated the trade war with China, which is still in effect.

""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump replied.

Meng's lawyers say the actions of the president and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in the cases of both Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and his political advisor Roger Stone make clear that his words are not just idle talk.

Flynn — who Trump called ""a good guy"" — pleaded guilty twice to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about conversations with Russia's ambassador, yet the case against him was dismissed after the U.S. Justice Department intervened.

Trump recently commuted a prison sentence for his long-time political advisor Roger Stone. Meng's lawyers say the action is proof Trump would intervene in her case if it suited him. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/The Associated Press)

In February, Trump demanded a new trial for Stone, calling himself ""the chief law enforcement officer of the country."" More recently, he acted to commute Stone's three year prison sentence for witness tampering and lying to Congress.

""The two examples show that the (U.S.) president not only thinks he can intervene in prosecutions, but that he will do so when it suits his political agenda,"" Meng's lawyers wrote.

They also said that Trump has already said that ""there is MUCH more to come"" when it comes to interventions.

The fate of two Canadians

The court documents also claim Trudeau contributed to the politicization of the case in statements he made to a French language TV show in December 2019 with regards to former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.

The two were detained in China within days of Meng's arrest and have since been accused of spying. Both men have been held in Chinese prisons for more than a year and a half.

Michael Spavor, left, and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, are in Chinese custody, both having been charged with spying. Meng's lawyers claim Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tied their fate to Meng's defence. (The Associated Press/International Crisis Group/The Canadian Press)

Trudeau claimed his government told the U.S. it ""should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.""

""As a bargaining chip in a global trade war, (Meng faces) intimidation regarding the ramifications her own decisions may have on others,"" her lawyers claim.

They say a reasonable person would believe that how Meng ""defends her extradition could alter the consequences faced by the two Canadians held in China.

Her defence strategy could also impact Huawei in its future interests as a globally competitive company, as well as Canada's economy.""

Meng's lawyers allege abuse of process

The legal arguments are all part of a series of attempts that the defence plans to make to have the case against Meng tossed for alleged abuse of process.

The same newly filed batch of court documents include an argument that the U.S. failed to disclose material facts in its record of the case that show Meng's statements to banks had no impact on the financial decisions in question.

If necessary, the defence team also plans to argue that Canadian and U.S. authorities conspired to violate Meng's Constitutional rights at the time of her arrest.

To that end, her lawyers will be in federal court next week to argue for the release of Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents that they claim prove collusion with the FBI.

Meng has been living under house arrest since her release on $10 million bail in the week after her initial arrest.

She wears a monitoring bracelet as part of her release conditions and lives in one of two multi-million mansions she owns on Vancouver's west side.

Joining a message thread on Thursday one year before the Olympic cauldron is lit at the postponed 2020 Tokyo Games, the International Olympic Committee used its official account to tweet a film about the first-ever torch relay entering the Berlin stadium.

""We apologize to those who feel offended by the film of the Olympic Games Berlin 1936,"" the IOC wrote on Friday.

""We have deleted this film, which was part of the series of films featuring the message of unity and solidarity, from the @Olympics Twitter account.""

Replies to the IOC's original message on Thursday expressed surprise by Twitter users at broadcasting footage from the Berlin Games, and suggested the Olympic body lacked awareness of history.

The official museum at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp added its reply to the IOC in the message thread on Friday.

""For 2 weeks the Nazi dictatorship camouflaged its racist, militaristic character,"" said the Auschwitz museum's verified account. ""It exploited the Games to impress foreign spectators with an image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany.""

25501,2020-07-24 13:08,"Online shopping has doubled during the pandemic, Statistics Canada says","Canadian consumers flocked to online shopping as lockdowns to combat the COVID-19 pandemic were instituted, according to a Statistics Canada report.

A new report from the agency found that total retail sales fell by 17.9 per cent as Canadians increasingly sheltered in place between February and May and brick-and-mortar stores closed their doors.

Even so, shoppers rushed to make online purchases, with sales surging 99.3 per cent during the period.

Statistics Canada says e-commerce sales hit a record $3.9 billion in May, a 2.3 per cent increase over April and 99.3 per cent increase over February.

E-commerce sales more than doubled year over year, with a 110.8 per cent increase compared with May 2019.

The report found that all 11 retail subsectors with e-commerce sales saw those sales increase.

The record gains in e-commerce occurred as total retail sales experienced record declines, the report says, with April data showing the most stark contrast. Retail sales that month plummeted to $33.9 billion, down 29.1 per cent from February and 26.4 per cent from the prior year. Meanwhile, e-commerce increased 63.8 per cent in April.

From February to April, only the food and beverage subsector saw an increase in in-store sales, which were up 3.3 per cent, while e-commerce sales surged 107 per cent. In-store sales declined for general merchandise stores, building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and health and personal care stores.

Other retail trade subsectors such as furniture and home furnishings stores, sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores, and clothing and clothing accessories stores saw much sharper declines in in-store sales from February to April 2020. As in-store sales decreased for these subsectors, e-commerce sales increased.

COVID-19 has changed how StatsCan collects and assesses data

Statistics Canada said it will continue to update the e-commerce data to assess the long-term changes after the pandemic, noting that as stores reopened in May, the proportion of e-commerce sales was 10 per cent, down from a record high of 11.4 per cent in April.

""Will the COVID-19 pandemic have a lasting impact on the retail trade sector? Small businesses are increasingly turning to e-commerce platforms, and are using these platforms in innovative ways,"" the report said.

The new data from Statistics Canada is the latest peek into a changing retail sector, also reflected in two other recent data releases. The consumer price index, released on July 22, suggested that consumer behaviour has shifted so much that it has thrown off the inflation index.

Overall retail sales data for May, released on July 21, indicated that while about 23 per cent of retailers were closed during the month, for an average of five business days, sales are 80 per cent recovered from the worst of the pandemic period.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/online-shopping-covid-19-1.5661818?cmp=rss,news,business,

""We're looking out for the protection of our community,"" said Chief April Martel.

The First Nation put a message out on social media on Thursday saying anyone with licence plates from out of the N.W.T. will be denied access to the reserve.

Martel said it was council's decision due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's out of control right now,"" she said. ""You're opening this gate and allowing people to go everywhere. It's scary. It's still scary for a lot of people. We're still in a pandemic right now.""

Martel said she frequently gets calls from First Nation members about Alberta and Saskatchewan licence plates on the reserve. She said many people come to fish, claiming they have Treaty 8 rights to be there.

""This is my reserve, so if I tell you to leave, you leave.""

The First Nation went into full lockdown back in March, at the height of the pandemic, blocking anyone who could not prove band membership. Martel says with the reserve's proximity to High Level, Alta. — about three hours away — she once again worries about COVID-19 making it onto the reserve. Alberta has recently seen a spike in cases.

""All the people are coming in from Alberta and driving around and we don't want to get anyone sick, especially our elders.""

The chief said she still sees people disobeying physical distancing requirements set by the N.W.T. public health office, and people who aren't in self-isolation when they should be. She said that's left people on the reserve scared — particularly staff at its Ehdah Cho Store, who need to sanitize each time someone from off the reserve comes in.

""They're scared right now … because they can't keep track of all of that. It's just too crazy.""

Martel said the First Nation is erecting a new sign asking out-of-territory visitors to turn back, which will remain up until they feel there is no longer an immediate risk of COVID-19 entering the reserve.

""You look at our medical supplies and our health-care system and we won't be able to keep up with that,"" she said.

The team's home opener was scheduled for Wednesday against the Washington Nationals, but that game and the game the following day both will be played in the U.S. capital with the Jays as the home team. Toronto plays two road games against Washington on Monday and Tuesday.

Toronto's first game in Buffalo will either be July 31 against the Philadelphia Phillies or Aug. 11 against the Miami Marlins.

Blue Jays To Stage Majority Of 2020 Home Games In Buffalo. <a href=""https://t.co/BxlV7cgieJ"">pic.twitter.com/BxlV7cgieJ</a> —@BlueJays

Canada's lone Major League Baseball team was forced to find a new home for 2020 after the federal government last week rejected the club's proposal for the Blue Jays and visiting teams to stay in the hotel inside Rogers Centre and never leave the facility during stints in Toronto.

The Blue Jays would have needed an exception to the traditional 14-day quarantine from the federal government to play in Toronto during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On a videoconference with reporters last Sunday, reliever Anthony Bass said the players expressed a desire to the team's front office to play home games at a major-league stadium this season.

But the state of Pennsylvania also didn't clear the Blue Jays to play home games in Pittsburgh.

Before the federal government's decision, the Blue Jays were considering their spring-training facility in Dunedin, Fla., and Buffalo.

But surging COVID-19 rates in Florida and a lack of space and lighting concerns in Buffalo raised questions about both those options, leading the Blue Jays to look at other major-league sites.

Several Blue Jays players and staff members reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 last month while working out in Dunedin.

In the end, the Blue Jays couldn't find another major-league stadium, and settled on Buffalo.

WATCH | MLB adjusts to the 'new normal':

Major League Baseball is back without fans in the stands, but while the return of baseball may be a comforting distraction for a country almost completely overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, politics now permeate every aspect of the game in the U.S. 2:07

Opened in 1988, Sahlen Field has a capacity of 16,600. But no fans will be in attendance this season.

The Buffalo Bisons became the Blue Jays' triple-A affiliate for the start of the 2013 season. Minor league baseball has been cancelled this year, creating an opening in Buffalo.

Sahlen Field is in downtown Buffalo, minutes from the Peace Bridge connecting the city to Fort Erie, Ont.

Several of the top young Blue Jays have spent time playing for the Bisons, including Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Cavan Biggio, Bo Bichette and Nate Pearson.

The federal government did agree to the modified quarantine at the Rogers Centre hotel for Blue Jays summer training camp, but said concerns about regular cross-border travel along with road games in hard-hit American states made the regular-season plan a no-go.

It won't be the first time a Canadian MLB team will play an extended stretch of home games outside the country.

25496,2020-07-24 12:14,"Indigenous man sues RCMP in B.C., claiming 'abusive' use of police dog left him in 'agony'","A man from Kamloops, B.C., is suing an RCMP officer from Prince George after being attacked by a police dog during a violent arrest caught on surveillance video more than four years ago.

Cuyler Richard Aubichon, who is Indigenous, claims Const. Joshua Grafton and the RCMP were ""reckless, arrogant, high-handed [and] abusive"" with a ""callous disregard"" for Aubichon's well-being when he was arrested in an alleyway on a snowy night in 2016.

""Grafton acted with complete and deliberate indifference towards the Plaintiff,"" alleges a notice of civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court on Thursday.

Grafton, along with two other RCMP constables, were criminally charged last month in connection with Aubichon's arrest in Prince George, B.C., on Feb. 18, 2016.

None of Aubichon's allegations has been proven. No response to the notice of claim has been filed.

Takedown caught on backyard camera

Video of Aubichon's arrest was captured by a backyard security camera. It shows the truck he was in boxed in by police, flood-lit by headlights of an RCMP cruiser.

The video then appears to show a man pulled from the truck by RCMP working with a police dog. After the man exits the truck, the dog lunges at him. An officer then appears to strike the man while he is on the ground.

Two men are stomped and kicked after police pull them from an allegedly stolen truck. One suspect's legal team seeks an investigation. 2:48

In his lawsuit, Aubichon claims Grafton ""encouraged"" the dog to bite his arm. It also alleges Grafton allowed the dog to continue biting him once he was face-down on the ground.

""Grafton encouraged the dog to continue biting the plaintiff, even though Grafton could hear the Plaintiff screaming in agony and begging Grafton to stop the dog,"" the claim reads.

""Grafton's conduct ... was physically and psychologically abusive and repetitive in the extreme.""

The notice said Grafton kicked Aubichon in the stomach and hit him with a police baton while he was laying on the ground, ""semi-conscious.""

Aubichon, then 22, claims to have suffered injuries to his face, leg, ribs, sternum, hand and the back of his head.

Aubichon claimed RCMP did not offer him medical assistance after taking him back to the RCMP detachment in Prince George. He said the incident caused physical, emotional and psychological trauma and left him ""humiliated.""

Police have previously said the case involved two suspects who were evading arrest in a stolen truck.

The same day the video was made public, the Independent Investigations Office of B.C. sent investigators to Prince George, at the request of the RCMP.

Const. Joshua Grafton was charged in June with assault, assault with a weapon and obstruction of justice. Const. Wayne Connell and Const. Kyle Sharpe were charged with assault causing bodily harm.

The three officers are scheduled to appear in provincial court in Prince George on Aug. 12. As of June 8, the officers remained on active duty.

""The officers' fitness to continue to be on active duty has been assessed. We are confident they can continue their duties in a manner that is safe and meets public expectation,"" Staff Sgt. Janelle Shoihet told CBC News last month.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cuyler-richard-aubichon-lawsuit-joshua-grafton-prince-george-rcmp-1.5661710?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25494,2020-07-24 12:00,"Scheer says Trudeau, Morneau need to step aside 'for the good of the country'","Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau need to ""step aside for the good of the country"" over the WE Charity scandal.

Speaking to reporters in Regina, Sask., Scheer said their departures would ""allow the government to move past these scandals"" and would ""improve the lives of Canadians.""

""These individuals need to do the right thing,"" he said.

Scheer said Liberal MPs should push for new leadership so that the party can ""rehabilitate its very tarnished image.""

Asked if it would be prudent for Trudeau and Morneau to resign while the country is in the grips of a pandemic, Scheer said their departures might actually improve the COVID-19 response because of what he called problems with the programs Ottawa has enacted to deal with the pandemic's social and economic effects.

He said if the two men won't go on their own, Liberal backbenchers should stage a caucus revolt to force them out.

""Liberal MPs have a choice to make. Are they prepared to sacrifice their integrity to protect a leader that is under investigation? If Liberals refuse to act, if they refuse to do anything, then they are implicitly approving of that behaviour,"" he said.

But Scheer said he's not prepared to trigger an election over this scandal.

He said Parliament is on a summer recess and there's no mechanism to defeat the government and prompt an election when the Commons isn't sitting.

He said it will be up to the next Conservative leader to decide how to proceed on that front. Scheer will be replaced at the end of August.

The weeks-long scandal — the botched partnership between Ottawa and WE to administer student grants, the conflict-of-interest allegations, the revelation that Trudeau's mother and brother were paid $300,000 in speaking fees by WE and news that Morneau's daughter also works for the charity — has had an impact on the charitable organization itself.

At least three major corporate partners have announced that they will be reviewing their relationship with WE Charity, which also has faced questions about its complex organizational structure and its Toronto-area real estate holdings.

U.K.-based Virgin Atlantic Airways said Friday says it has ""temporarily paused"" its funding arrangement with WE.

Virgin, whose website refers to WE as its ""main charity partner,"" says it has halted payments after contributing more than $10 million to the organization since 2010.

""We're aware of reports relating to WE Charity and WE Day speaker payments,"" the airline said in a statement.

RBC Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, said it is ""reassessing the programs we've been delivering with WE to support young Canadians over the past several years.""

""Foundational to all our relationships, RBC expects our partners to conduct their business in accordance with our values, policies and practices,"" a spokesperson for the bank said.

The Globe and Mail also reported that Telus, a major telecommunications company, will stop providing funds to WE for WE Day events.

""Telus and WE mutually agreed to terminate our sponsorship, which was originally supposed to expire in 2022,"" the company told the newspaper.

Scheer said Conservatives want to know if other members of Trudeau's cabinet have had ties to the WE Charity or if they've been treated to complimentary trips to see WE projects like Morneau.

He said they want to know if Trudeau has any ""last-minute confessions"" to make ahead of his finance committee appearance — like Morneau's revelation that he failed to repay WE for $41,000 in travel-related expenses in 2017.

Scheer said he also wants cabinet ministers to come clean about what they knew about the personal ties between Trudeau and Morneau and the WE Charity.

Asked Friday if he knew about the Trudeau and Morneau family links to the charity when approving the $912 million summer student grants agreement, Families Minister Ahmed Hussen said he wouldn't discuss cabinet conversations.

He wouldn't answer when pressed to say whether he and his cabinet colleagues understood just how closely linked the PM and the finance minister were with the charity picked to connect students with volunteer opportunities.

Scheer said it's inappropriate for Morneau and Trudeau to blame Youth Minister Bardish Chagger and bureaucrats for the unfolding scandal. Trudeau has said it was public servants who first recommended WE for the deal because of its nationwide network. Morneau told the finance committee that it was Chagger who brought the WE Charity contract to cabinet, and that she was the one who signed off on the plan before seeking approval from other ministers.

""This whole scandal reeks of corruption at the highest level,"" Scheer said.

Hussen and Middle Class Prosperity Minister Mona Fortier defended Morneau at a child care announcement in Ottawa today. They said they have complete confidence in Morneau and believe he should stay on finance minister.

""Minister Morneau has apologized and has been transparent since this situation [started] and I will continue to have full confidence in him,"" Fortier said.

Hussen said Morneau has invested in people and has grown program spending to help parents through the Canada Child Benefit.

""Those are the kind of things that keep me working and continuing to have faith in Finance Minister Morneau,"" Hussen said.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu also said Friday that she has confidence in Morneau and praised what she called his speedy fiscal response to the pandemic.

A handful of police chiefs and academics are also weighing in as the MPs on the committee consider recommendations for the federal government.

The committee starts at 11 a.m. ET and runs all day, with breaks. CBC News will carry it live online.

The RCMP is under pressure to explain its conduct in a number of high-profile cases involving Indigenous people.

The June death of Rodney Levi, a member of the Metepenagiag First Nation in New Brunswick, is under investigation after he was shot and killed last month. His family said he suffered from mental health problems.

And questions still linger after video surfaced of an RCMP officer tackling Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam outside of a casino after he was stopped for driving with expired licence plates. The officer said the chief was resisting arrest.

Earlier this summer, RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki faced a backlash for saying in several media interviews that she was struggling to define the term ""systemic racism."" She later reversed herself, issuing a statement saying she believes systemic racism exists in the RCMP.

Disproportionately policed

Yesterday, the committee heard from a handful of Indigenous leaders, who called for a sweeping national review of the the RCMP's policing policies.

""We definitely need a change in policing in this country that we call Canada,"" said Terry Teegee, a regional chief with the British Columbia Assembly of First Nations.

Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami president Natan Obed stressed that any review should involve the Inuit communities he represents.

""We as Inuit disproportionately experience police violence compared to most other Canadians, as well as a host of challenges in accessing justice,"" he said.

""We are tired of being left on the sidelines when there are reviews because, in the end, our views and our perspectives are always at risk of being drowned out by other considerations.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/systemic-racism-policing-study-1.5661662?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25484,2020-07-24 10:41,Christopher Columbus statues taken down at 2 Chicago parks,"A statue of Christopher Columbus in downtown Chicago's Grant Park was taken down early Friday, a week after protesters trying to topple the monument to the Italian explorer clashed with police.

Crews used a large crane to remove the statue from its pedestal as a small crowd gathered to watch. The crowd cheered and passing cars honked as the statue came down at about 3 a.m. local time. Several work trucks were seen in the area, but it was unclear where the statue would be taken.

A second statue of Columbus was also removed at about 5:30 a.m. Friday from Arrigo Park in Chicago's Little Italy neighbourhood.

The Associated Press sent an email and left a telephone message Friday seeking comment from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office.

Plans to remove the Grant Park statue were first reported Thursday night by the Chicago Tribune and the removal followed hours of vocal confrontations between opponents and supporters of the statue. On July 17, protesters had clashed with police, who used batons to beat people and made arrests after they say protesters targeted them with fireworks, rocks and other items.

(Tyler LaRiviere/Chicago Sun-Times/The Associated Press)

""This statue coming down is because of the effort of Black and Indigenous activists who know the true history of Columbus and what he represents,"" Stefan Cuevas-Caizaguano, a resident watching the removal, told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Both the Grant Park and Arrigo Park statues were vandalized last month. Statues of Columbus have also been toppled or vandalized in other U.S. cities as protesters have called for their removal, saying that he is responsible for the genocide and exploitation of Indigenous people in the Americas.

Pasquale Gianni of the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans said the mayor had told him before their removal that both statues would be moved and temporarily housed elsewhere for public safety reasons.

""The Italian American community feels betrayed. The Mayor's Office is giving into a vocal and destructive minority. This is not how the Democratic process is supposed to work,"" he told WLS-TV.

The removals come amid a plan by U.S. President Donald Trump to dispatch federal law enforcement agents to the city to respond to gun violence, prompting worries that the surge will inhibit residents' ability to hold demonstrations. A collection of activist groups had filed suit Thursday, seeking to block federal agents to combat violent crime from interfering in or policing protests.

State officials in Oregon had sued for similar requests following the arrival of federal law enforcement due to nearly two months of protests in Portland since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Confederate monuments gone from Virginia state capitol

The state of Virginia, meanwhile, has removed from its iconic state capitol the busts and a statue honouring Confederate generals and officials. That includes a bronze statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee positioned in the same spot where he stood to assume command of the state's armed forces in the Civil War nearly 160 years ago.

They are the latest Confederate symbols to be removed or retired in the weeks since the death of Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, which sparked a nationwide protest movement.

Virginia House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, a Democrat, quietly ordered the Lee statue and busts of generals J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall Jackson, as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and others removed from the historic Old House Chamber. A moving crew worked through the night Thursday — carefully removing the monuments and their plaques and loading them into a truck and taking them to an undisclosed location.

25488,2020-07-24 10:15,NHLers ready for awkward bubble moments: 'I don't think it'll be too friendly',"Tuukka Rask doesn't expect any problems living under the same roof as his rivals.

He's not so sure about everyone else.

""I don't have too many enemies in the league because you're a goalie and you're just out there on an island,"" said the veteran Boston Bruins netminder, who shares a locker room with star winger and noted pest Brad Marchand. ""But it might be different for some of my teammates.

""If you play a seven-game playoff series and there's some heat going on between the teams ... probably not playing ping pong together at the hotel.""

The 24 clubs set to battle in the NHL's restart of its pandemic-hit season that was suspended in mid-March will head to the hub cities of Toronto and Edmonton — where players and coaches will be locked down inside a bubble away from the general public in hopes keeping COVID-19 at bay — on Sunday.

Two hotels in each market will house the teams, which could lead to some interesting dynamics in the restaurants, lounges and other common areas. There's a long list of rules related to physical distancing, and each 52-person travelling party will have its own space to both prepare and relax, but there's a good chance of some awkward moments with hundreds of NHLers trying to grab hold of the Stanley Cup living in close proximity.

The Toronto Maple Leafs and Columbus Blue Jackets, for example, are two of 10 franchises that will be both staying at the same complex and poised to meet in the best-of-five qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs.

""It'll be something new, that's for sure,"" Leafs defenceman Jake Muzzin said. ""I don't know what it's going to be like. We'll find out when we're there.""

St. Louis Blues centre Ryan O'Reilly, whose team will begin its title defence in the Western Conference's round-robin tournament to determine the top-4 seeds on that side of the bracket in Edmonton, said it will be strange running into someone you butted heads with in a game at the hotel the next morning.

""Once you go on the ice it's a war,"" he said. ""I don't think it'll be too friendly around the bubble.""

Washington Capitals defenceman John Carlson and his teammates will be housed at the same Toronto hotel as the Pittsburgh Penguins, Philadelphia Flyers, Tampa Bay Lightning and Bruins, but doesn't envision any real tension.

""Seeing a lot of your playoff opponents wouldn't necessarily be a normal feeling, but we're all professionals,"" he said. ""We're all grateful just to be able to be in that bubble and to be playing hockey at this time. There'll be a lot of adjustments across the board, and that certainly is going to be something we haven't seen before.""

In the final preview of this 10 part series, Rob Pizzo looks at a Panthers team trying to put a tough regular season behind them as they take on the Islanders. 1:10

Flames centre Mikael Backlund likened being in the same hotel as Calgary's qualifying round opponent — the Winnipeg Jets — to his experience at the world championships.

""It's going to be even harder now because we're going to play against one team,"" Backlund said. ""To see them in the hallway and you had a battle or something, maybe not too happy to see a guy.""

Capitals head coach Todd Reirden said the idea of being anywhere near an opponent off the ice would have been severely frowned upon during his playing days.

""You were always cautious of not being in the same hotel as another team,"" he said. ""But this is what it takes. We're just all happy to be able to play hockey during a situation like this and provide entertainment — try to get back to some normalcy in our world.

""There may be some head down, stare downs occasionally with a few of the opposition, but I don't really expect it too much.""

The fact of the matter is times have changed in hockey. The strong dislike among players of generations past is mostly gone. There's a lot more socializing away from the rink, both during and after the season.

""If you had laid this (hub) scenario out to me 20 years ago, I would say there's a better chance of a fist fight in the lobby,"" Winnipeg head coach Paul Maurice joked.

Montreal Canadiens counterpart Claude Julien, however, won't be surprised if something happens at some point during the resumption of play, which gets going in earnest Aug. 1 and could run through the first week of October.

""Back in the day, there was a lot of animosity,"" said Julien, who played 12 pro seasons. ""You might even see that in these series as we move forward here where there's going to be some animosity. Who knows what's going to happen in the hotels? That's something we're going to experience as we go along. We wouldn't dare look at the other team. If we did, there was a dirty look.

""Hopefully when it gets to the hotel, we won't need referees or body guards to break up some fights.""

Each bubble gets 14 restaurants

The NHL has unveiled details for hub cities and in-game presentation as it approaches its restart next month in Edmonton and Toronto.

In a video released by the league, the NHL reveals its plan for health and safety, along with information about television broadcasts and player amenities during a period in which no fans will be allowed in the arenas.

NHL personnel in the bubbles are to be separated from the general public during the pandemic under an agreement reached with the federal government.

The NHL says it will use DynaLIFE Medical Labs in Edmonton and LifeLabs in Toronto for daily COVID-19 testing.

Each bubble has 14 restaurants for players and staff and there is a concierge service for players to get delivery.

BMO Field in Toronto — normally the home of Toronto FC of the MLS and the CFL's Argonauts — is part of the bubble, serving as an outdoor recreation facility.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was scheduled to attend the inaugural prayers inside the sixth-century monument along with around 500 dignitaries, as he fulfills what he has described as the ""dream of our youth"" anchored in Turkey's Islamic movement.

Thousands of men and women, including many who travelled from across Turkey, quickly filled specially designated, segregated areas outside of Hagia Sophia to be part of the first prayers.

Several camped near the structure overnight. Dozens of worshippers broke through one police checkpoint to rush toward Hagia Sophia. Social distancing practices, in place due to the coronavirus outbreak, were being ignored, Turkish media reported.

Orthodox church leaders in Greece and the United States, meanwhile, were scheduled to observe ""a day of mourning"" over the inaugural prayers.

UNESCO heritage site

Brushing aside international criticism, Erdogan issued a decree restoring the iconic building as a mosque earlier this month, shortly after a Turkish high court ruled that the Hagia Sophia had been illegally made into a museum more than eight decades ago.

The structure, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, has since been renamed the Grand Hagia Sophia Mosque.

The move sparked dismay in Greece, the U.S. and among Christian churches, which had called on Erdogan to maintain it as a museum as a nod to Istanbul's multi-religious heritage and the structure's status as a symbol of Christian and Muslim unity. Pope Francis expressed his sadness.

Built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in 537, Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque with the 1453 Ottoman conquest of Istanbul. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding leader of the secular Turkish republic, converted the structure into a museum in 1934.

Turkey's highest administrative court voted on July 10 to revoke the structure's status as a museum, allowing it to be converted back to a mosque. (Burak Kara/Getty Images)

Although an annex to the Hagia Sophia, the Sultan's pavilion, has been open to prayers since the 1990s, religious and nationalist groups in Turkey have long yearned for the nearly 1,500-year-old edifice, which they regard as the legacy of Ottoman Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer, to be reverted to a mosque.

""This is Hagia Sophia breaking away from its captivity chains. It was the greatest dream of our youth,"" Erdogan said last week. ""It was the yearning of our people and it has been accomplished.""

Erdogan also described its conversion into a museum by the republic's founding leaders as a mistake that is being rectified.

'Today is a difficult day'

In neighbouring Greece, bells tolled and flags flew at half-staff at hundreds of churches across the country in protest of the decision to convert Hagia Sophia into a mosque.

The Greek Orthodox Church leader, Archbishop Ieronymos, will hold a special service at Athens Cathedral later on Friday. Churches in Athens and Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki, are also organizing vigils.

""Today is a difficult day ... a shadow hangs over us with the transformation of Hagia Sophia into a mosque — something that genuinely shocks Christians all over the world, and not only Greeks,"" Greek government spokesperson Stelios Petsas said in an interview with private channel Open TV.

""We have warned for some time that this will create an unbridgeable gap between Turkey and the Christian world.""

The history and religious traditions of the predominantly Greek-speaking and Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire remain influential in Greece.

The church protests also occurred amid a volatile dispute between Greece and Turkey over mineral rights in the eastern Mediterranean, with the Greek military on alert over a planned Turkish maritime survey in waters claimed by Greece.

The deal includes a $2.5 billion cash payout by Goldman and a guarantee by the bank to return at least $1.4 billion in assets linked to 1MDB bonds, Malaysia's finance ministry said in a statement.

""We are confident that we are securing more money from Goldman Sachs compared to previous attempts, which were far below expectations,"" Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz said in a statement.

""We are also glad to be able to resolve this outside the court system, which would have cost a lot of time, money and resources,"" he said.

The deal would resolve all outstanding charges and claims against Goldman Sachs, he said.

Malaysian prosecutors filed charges in December 2018 against three Goldman Sachs units for misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund, the 1Malaysia Development Berhad.

Former PM hears verdict in case next week

Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying that certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used. The units of Goldman Sachs had pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges.

Goldman Sachs confirmed the $3.9 billion settlement and said it had reached an agreement in principle with Malaysia to resolve all criminal and regulatory proceedings in the country involving the firm.

U.S. and Malaysian authorities say about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and Goldman Sachs, among others.

A Malaysian court will deliver its verdict in the case against Najib on Tuesday, the first of several corruption trials he faces linked to the 1MDB scandal.

25505,2020-07-24 8:00,"'Illegal assault' on First Nations brothers by police caught on video was racist, lawsuit alleges","Ontario Provincial Police officers allegedly falsified their notes to justify a racially influenced violent takedown of two First Nations brothers in Orillia, Ont., that was caught on cellphone video, according to a lawsuit filed in an Ontario court this week.

The lawsuit, seeking $400,000 in damages, names the Ontario government, two identified OPP officers and a number of unknown officers. It was filed in Toronto on Wednesday.

It alleges that the two officers, acting on a report that a ""Native male"" had fallen off a bicycle, illegally assaulted Randall May, 57, of Nipissing First Nation, and Aaron Keeshig, 50, of Neyaashiinigmiing First Nation.

The lawsuit also alleges that an OPP officer, assigned to investigate a complaint over the incident filed by May, offered to have May's charges dropped if he abandoned the complaint, according to the statement of claim.

The legal action comes at a time of heightened awareness of racial profiling by the police against Black and Indigenous people and amid worldwide protests over recent high-profile incidents of police brutality.

In Canada, two Indigenous people were shot and killed by police in New Brunswick within a span of eight days in June. Chantal Moore, 26, was killed by police in Edmunston during a wellness check at her home while Rodney Levi, 48, of Metepenagiag First Nation, was fatally shot by the RCMP.

The incident involving the OPP in Orillia unfolded in the front yard and driveway of May's home and was captured in cellphone video that was obtained by CBC News.

""In order to justify the illegal assault, detention and arrest, the police falsified police notes, falsely accused both brothers of offences they did not commit and wrongly charged Mr. May of assaulting police,"" said the statement of claim, filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

(Ousama Farag/CBC News)

""Mr. May and Mr. Keeshig, who are both First Nations men, assert that the illegal, violent and entirely unjustified treatment they suffered was the result of racial profiling, racial bias and discrimination.""

The OPP said in a statement it couldn't comment on ongoing litigation.

However, its statement said that the OPP's professional standards bureau investigated the complaint filed by May in February 2019, at the direction of the police watchdog, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD).

The statement said the internal investigation concluded that the allegations were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the findings were relayed by the OIPRD to May. The file was closed in May 2019, the OPP's statement said.

The police force hasn't yet filed a statement of defence because it was just served with the lawsuit.

Lawsuit alleges man was repeatedly Tasered

May told CBC News he doesn't remember ever receiving the results of the investigation from the OIPRD.

The lawsuit claims he suffered the worst during the takedown. He was thrown to the ground, punched and repeatedly Tasered to the point where he lost control of his bodily functions, according to the statement of claim.

""I could hear myself screaming,"" May said in an interview with CBC News outside his home, at the spot where the incident occurred on Sept. 15, 2018.

It was sunny that Saturday evening when May and Keeshig returned on their bicycles from a restaurant to May's home, which sits on a lot surrounded by thick bushes and trees on a dead-end street.

May said he was walking his bicycle and crossing his driveway when he noticed an OPP cruiser pull up and an officer emerge.

""I had no idea what they were doing here,"" he said.

""He grabbed my bike and I said, 'What are you doing? You're on private property.' And he said that he got a complaint [that] some Native man walking down the road fell off his bike.""

Cellphone video shows incident

Cellphone video, recorded by May's relative, Jessie Fancy, captured what happened next.

The video shows one officer, identified as Sgt. Mark Connor, shoving May into the bushes as Keeshig arrived, walking his bike.

Connor then told Keeshig to ""back off"" as May struggled to his feet, according to the video.

Keeshig inched closer and Connor repeated his warning.

""Don't be rough on my bro,"" Keeshig said, according to the video.

Aaron Keeshig, outside his brother Randall May's home near Orillia, Ont., says he knew that if he resisted police, it could have been much worse. (Ousama Farag/CBC News)

Sirens are heard in the background as Connor pushes Keeshig back before turning his attention to May. The sound of a Taser cracks in the air.

A second officer, Const. Andrew Markle, then appeared, grabbed Keeshig by the arm and flipping him to the gravel driveway.

""Get on the ground,"" Markle is heard saying as he pinned Keeshig down and handcuffed him.

Markle then moved to back up Connor, who yelled at May to ""stop resisting"" and ""put your hands behind your back.""

The sound of Taser charges are audible, along with May's screams.

""Now they're punching him,"" Fancy is heard saying on the video.

""Connor continued to shock Mr. May with successive rounds shot from his Taser while Mr. May lay prone and defenceless on the ground.... At least one of the police officers yanked the Taser barbs out of Mr. May's skin before shooting him again,"" the statement of claim said.

""Connor and ... Markle then began to punch Mr. May repeatedly, while one of them yelled 'put your hand behind your back or I will Taser you again!'""

The lawsuit alleges that May was Tasered so many times that he became incontinent.

""They threw me in the back of this car and I guess I was just full of excrement,"" he said.

May said the OPP did not provide him with a change of clothes or any blankets while he was in the holding cell overnight. He was forced to wash his soiled clothes in the toilet bowl, which he couldn't flush, he said.

""I basically slept beside my own excrement,"" May said.

""I guess they were trying to humiliate me.""

Charges withdrawn by the Crown

May was charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, along with two counts under the Liquor Licence Act of being intoxicated in a public place and having open liquor.

His criminal charges were withdrawn by the Crown in November 2018 and his liquor charges were withdrawn in April 2019.

Keeshig faced charges under the Liquor Licence Act of being intoxicated in a public place and having open liquor. He was convicted after an administrative error, but the conviction was overturned in March 2019.

The statement of claim alleges that the officers ""illegally"" detained May and Keeshig, and they never informed either man of the reason for their arrest. The document said the brothers were the victims of ""assault and battery"" at the hands of the officers.

""The force was excessive, unreasonable and not justifiable at law,"" the statement of claim said.

It also alleges that the officers ""falsified their police notes and other official records,"" claiming May was in a fighting stance, put up his fist, was aggressive and pushed Connor.

Aaron Keeshig shows some of the injuries he sustained by the Ontario Provincial Police on Sept. 15, 2018. (Courtesy of Randall May)

""Any resistance to the detention and arrest was passive in nature and was justified in law by the fact that ... Connor had no grounds to arrest or detain Mr. May and therefore had no grounds to use force against him,"" the statement of claim said.

The document alleges that the officers falsely claimed that Keeshig fell off his bike when he arrived at May's home and was carrying an open can of beer. The video clearly shows he was walking his bike when he arrived and was not holding a can of beer, which the statement of claim also alleges.

The officers also falsely alleged that Keeshig tried to interfere with the arrest, according to the statement of claim.

""Keeshig was never anywhere near Mr. May and fully complied with the instructions to stay back,"" said the statement of claim, an assertion largely supported by the cellphone video.

Keeshig said in an interview he knew that if he resisted, it could have been much worse.

""I'd imagine if I would have stood up for myself ... I probably would've got shot, too, maybe not with a Taser gun either, probably a real gun,"" he said.

Officer allegedly offered deal

The statement of claim alleges that after May filed a complaint with the OIPRD about his treatment, the police watchdog asked the OPP to investigate, and the provincial police turned the matter over to its professional standards bureau.

One of the officers assigned to the file then offered May a quid pro quo, the lawsuit claims.

""One OPP officer even went so far as to offer to withdraw Mr. May's criminal charges if he in turn would withdraw the OIPRD complaint,"" the statement of claim said.

The document alleges that the officers assigned to investigate ""began harassing Mr. May and pressuring him to drop the complaint.""

The OIPRD said it couldn't comment due to privacy laws.

May and Keeshig's Toronto-based lawyer, Promise Holmes Skinner, said she believes racism clearly played a role in the officer's actions.

""There is no doubt in my mind that if Randy was a white man, none of this would have happened,"" Holmes-Skinner said.

Ottawa says COVID-19 tracing app now in beta testing.

India becomes the 7th country to see over 30,000 COVID-19 deaths.

Britain's indoor mask rules go into effect.

South Korea to begin allowing fans at pro sports stadiums, slowly.

The White House touted a coronavirus briefing on Thursday by Donald Trump as a discussion of a strategy to reopen U.S. schools, but some education experts were left underwhelmed.

Trump insisted that every school should be ""actively making preparations to open."" Students need to be in school buildings to prevent learning setbacks, he said, and to access meal programs and mental health services.

Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made opening schools a key priority to restart the economy. Students need to return to the classroom so their parents can return to work, the president has said.

DeVos has echoed those sentiments and she erroneously told a conservative radio show last week that ""kids are actually stoppers of the virus.""

Trump's push has at times put him at odds with his own health officials. Earlier this month, he said school guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were too tough, prompting the agency to promise updated guidance.

""He's provided no plan and no funding and has ignored the health experts,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest education unions. ""Teachers won't let him get away with it.""

The CDC on Thursday added new information to its website on opening schools, but it did not appear to remove any of its earlier suggestions. Much of the new material emphasized the importance of reopening schools.

The CDC updated guidance laid out a range of measures depending on the level of spread. If there's minimal or moderate spread, it recommends physical distancing, masks and increased sanitation.

The agency allowed that in areas with substantive and uncontrolled spread, school closure is an ""important consideration.""

""Plans for virtual learning should be in place in the event of a school closure,"" the CDC said.

The Los Angeles and San Diego districts have already announced a plan to keep classes online this fall, while New York City's schools plan to offer a mix of online and in-person instruction.

Many states said they urgently need funding to implement safety measures. A group of state education chiefs said in the spring U.S. schools would need more than $200 billion US to prepare for a fall reopening.

Trump on Thursday said he's asking Congress to provide $105 billion in education funding as part of the next virus relief bill. It's meant to help schools reduce class sizes, hire teachers, rearrange spaces and provide masks, he said.

Meanwhile, Trump has made his most unequivocal pitch for Americans to wear masks to slow the spread of the virus this week, but political battles over the face coverings are still taking place in the U.S.

Republican attorney general Derek Schmidt of Kansas said he believes both counties and local school districts can exempt themselves from the governor's order requiring schools to have staff and students wear masks because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly replied in a scathing statement, accusing him of creating ""more hurdles and uncertainty"" during the pandemic. Kelly issued her masks-in-schools order Monday, imposing rules that are stricter than guidelines set by the state board of education.

As well, a Georgia judge on Thursday ordered Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms to enter mediation over the governor's lawsuit aimed at stopping the city from enforcing its requirement that people wear masks in public.

The Republican governor's office filed a lawsuit on July 16 against Bottoms and the Atlanta city council, arguing that local officials lack the legal authority to override Kemp's orders. Should mediation fail, an emergency hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

What's happening with coronavirus in Canada

As of 7:30 a.m. ET on Friday, Canada has seen 112,671 confirmed coronavirus cases. Provinces and territories listed 98,519 of those as recovered or resolved and a total of 5,244 still active. A CBC News tally based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting indicates that 8,908 Canadians have died.

The federal government says a smartphone app meant to warn users if they've been in close contact with someone who tests positive for coronavirus is now in beta testing.

(CBC News)

The app was supposed to be tried out in Ontario starting early this month, but the trial to look for bugs and other problems was delayed.

Now, the Canadian Digital Service — an agency that puts federal services online — is asking people to sign up for the app and try it out.

What's happening in the rest of the world

Britain is requiring citizens to wear face coverings in shops effective Friday, joining a long list of countries that have made masks mandatory under some circumstances in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

After weeks of prevarication and days of confused messaging, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government laid down the mask edict on July 13 due to ""growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from coronavirus.""

Many European nations, including Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece, already required masks to be worn in enclosed spaces, but Britain had only made masks obligatory on public transit.

Those who flout the law can be fined up to 100 pounds ($170 Cdn) by police under public health laws.

Meanwhile, Johnson said Friday he thought the country would be through the coronavirus crisis by mid-2021.

""Whether it came from ... a bat, a pangolin or however it emerged, it was a very, very nasty thing for the human race. And I think by the middle of next year we will be well on the way past it,"" he told reporters.

France is reporting a sharp uptick in coronavirus cases, with more than 1,000 new infections on Thursday.

Health authorities say cases on the French mainland have surged by 66 per cent in the past three weeks, with a 26 per cent increase in the last week alone. Concerns about rising cases had already prompted the government to make mask-wearing mandatory in all indoor public spaces this week.

In their daily update on France's outbreak that has already killed 30,182 people, health authorities said people aren't taking as much care to physically distance and that ""our recent habits have favoured the spread of the virus for several weeks now.""

There's new hope this week in the quest for a COVID-19 vaccine. Trials for two vaccines, one at Oxford University and another being worked on here in Canada, are showing some promising results.

The Health Ministry on Friday added 740 deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, increasing the toll to 30,601. The total now exceeds France's toll, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

India also registered a record 49,310 new cases. As cases surge, the Home Ministry advised all government offices, states and officials to avoid congregations for Aug. 15 Independence Day celebrations.

Major League Baseball held its Opening Day in the U.S. on Thursday for an abbreviated season, but fans were not present for precautionary reasons. In South Korea, baseball fans are to return to the stands beginning Sunday as health authorities outlined a phased process to bring back spectators in professional sports amid the pandemic.

Senior Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho during a virus briefing on Friday also said fans will be allowed at professional soccer games starting on Aug. 1. However, professional golf tournaments will continue without galleries at least until late August, he said.

Both baseball and soccer teams will be initially allowed to sell only 10 per cent of the seats for each game to begin. Fans will also be screened for fevers and required to sit apart in the seats. They will be required to wear masks, banned from eating food and drinking beer, and discouraged from excessive shouting, singing and cheering during the game.

Stadium officials will also register fans with smartphone QR codes so that they could be easily located when needed.

25455,2020-07-24 7:00,'Everything is connected': Aklavik's beluga whale harvest challenged on multiple fronts,"The beluga whale harvest out of Aklavik, in the Northwest Territories, is down but not out. From a high of 35 whales harvested in 1981, it has hit zero twice in the past five years.

And it's not for a lack of whales — the population of eastern Beaufort Sea belugas remain in relative abundance at about 40,000 animals.

A recent study out of the University of Manitoba documents what's behind the decline of the Aklavik hunt. It was a community-driven project.

""The research question was developed by Aklavik and we worked on the whole project together,"" said Elizabeth Worden, a research associate with the Centre for Earth Observation Science at the University of Manitoba, and the lead author on the study.

No single factor dominates, but the challenges wrought by climate change, the death of elders and the loss of their knowledge, and the preference for modern life among some of the community's youth have all contributed to its decline.

""Everything is connected,"" Worden said. ""It's quite a Western thing to try to separate things into themes and categories. It was very challenging to do that because everything influences everything.""

Elizabeth Worden, a research associate at the University of Manitoba, was the lead author of the study. (Elizabeth Worden)

Aklavik is near the northern border of the Northwest Territories and Yukon. An elbow bend of the Peel River hugs the community of about 600 people, who are mostly of Gwich'in and Inuvialuit descent.

Situated inland of its traditional whaling grounds on the Beaufort Sea, it's a four-hour boat ride through the complicated waterways of the Mackenzie River estuary of the Beaufort Delta.

Inuvialuit oral tradition says residents of the Mackenzie Delta region — which includes Aklavik, Inuvik, Tsiigehtchic, Fort McPherson, Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok and Tuktoyaktuk — harvested hundreds of beluga whales every season along the Beaufort Sea since at least the late 1800s.

Those rates continued throughout most of the 20th century.

The whales have long been important to Inuvialuit communities. The skin and outer blubber are made into muktuk, which is a good source of nutrition in a region where the price of store-bought groceries is high.

Hunters harvested almost 100 whales every year in the region between 2000 and 2012, but Aklavik's portion of that harvest declined over the same time.

Changing climate

Climate change has made the hunt more difficult, more expensive, and less predictable.

""A very significant finding in the end was that the traditionally preferred whaling camp, which is called West Whitefish, or in Inuvialuktun, Niaqunnaq … was lost through erosion and coastline change,"" Worden said.

With the loss of West Whitefish and another camp — Running River or Aqpaȓuatchiaq — harvesters from Aklavik now rely on Shingle Point (Tapqaq). Shingle Point was where part of an eight-week fieldwork portion of the study took place in 2017.

But harvesting at Shingle Point, according to the study, has itself become more challenging because of increased use of noisy all-terrain vehicles and powerful outboard boat motors that drive the shy animals away from shallow waters closer to shore.

Not only is it expensive to buy the gas and equipment to get to Shingle Point — it can cost up to $500 in gas — but the deep-water hunt is more costly and less certain. According to the study, storms are said to be more frequent and severe than in the past.

""We have very deep waters on this side [of the Beaufort Sea],"" said Michelle Gruben, the resource person for the Aklavik Hunters and Trappers Committee.

""So when the boat does go out to harvest, there might be a pod of whales, but … when they start to get to them, they dive and they go down.""

Gruben said she worked closely with Worden on the study. She is credited as a co-author.

Threats to traditional way of life

Along with climate change are the challenges presented by social change.

For youth in Aklavik, the traditional lifestyle competes with wage jobs, social media and the conveniences of modern life.

""There are some younger youth that love this traditional food,"" Gruben said. ""But there's some [in the] younger generation that would rather go to the store and buy a TV dinner or sub, you know, because their parents are not showing them traditional food.

""I guess we could say Aklavik is split down the middle.""

Michelle Gruben, with the Aklavik Hunters and Trappers Committee, is optimistic about the beluga whale hunt's future. (Submitted by Michelle Gruben)

On-the-land harvesting camps where the young and old share knowledge of the hunt are the preferred way to keep the activity alive.

Gruben said it could cost upward of $20,000 to hold a whale harvest camp with youth and elders on the land over several days.

""But there's money out there,"" she said. ""It takes time to do the paperwork and find the funding and do the reporting, but it's all worth it in the end. Even if one person came to gain the knowledge.""

Gruben said younger community members have already harvested five whales this season.

That goes to show the tradition lives on, she said.

25485,2020-07-24 6:30,N.S. evaluating N.B. proposal to collaborate on serious incident response team,"For years, New Brunswick has relied on agencies outside its borders to come in and investigate when there's a serious incident involving police.

But a new proposal to Nova Scotia's Serious Incident Response Team, or SIRT, could provide the province with its own version of an independent police watchdog.

Nova Scotia SIRT director Felix Cacchione said he sent New Brunswick's proposal to Nova Scotia's deputy minister of justice and is awaiting a meeting with the minister.

The idea of New Brunswick collaborating with at least one other Atlantic province on a serious incident response team isn't new.

But it's gained momentum after the fatal police shootings of two Indigenous people only days apart in June, which also prompted calls for a public inquiry into systemic racism.

Chantel Moore, 26, was shot and killed by an officer who was carrying out a wellness check on the Nuu-chah-nulth woman of Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation in B.C.

Days later, a Sunny Corner RCMP officer shot and killed 48-year-old Rodney Levi from Metepenagiag First Nation.

Chantel Moore, 26, and Rodney Levi, 48, were shot and killed by police in New Brunswick eight days apart. CBC has permission from Moore's family to use the photos included in this story. (CBC)

""After that, there seemed to be a renewed conversation,"" Cacchione said.

With half of Nova Scotia SIRT's investigators focused on investigating incidents related to the April mass shootings, the shooting deaths of Moore and Levi are being investigated by the Quebec Bureau des Enquêtes Indépendantes (BEI).

But relying on other agencies to help is not feasible in the future, according to Cacchione.

""We definitely do not have the manpower to cover the province of New Brunswick,"" he said.

Former government was trying to get 'consensus' on SIRT

Back in 2017, momentum seemed to be building on creating an Atlantic SIRT.

All four provinces were involved in discussions that were backed by the four premiers at the time, according to documents CBC News obtained through access to information.

So why hasn't it happened?

Denis Landry, the Liberal MLA for Bathurst East-Nepisiguit-Saint-Isidore and the minister of public safety in the previous government, said establishing such a unit would require changes to legislation, notably the Police Act.

Former New Brunswick minister of public safety, Denis Landry, said the government was trying to reach consensus with a number of organizations on the idea of a serious incident response team. (Ed Hunter/CBC)

To do that, his government was trying to obtain consensus from a number of organizations, including municipalities and police unions.

""I think there were little disagreements here and there and this is what we were working on to make or to obtain a consensus between all of those different organizations,"" Landry said.

He wouldn't elaborate on which stakeholder was resistant to the idea.

Without an agreement for an Atlantic SIRT, Newfoundland and Labrador went ahead and formed its own investigative team, while Prince Edward Island has a memorandum of understanding that would have Nova Scotia SIRT investigate when needed.

""Given the demands on the Nova Scotia team and their work with the other Atlantic provinces we didn't want to risk a lack of available resources should a response be required in this province,"" Lesley Clarke, a spokesperson for Newfoundland and Labrador's Department of Justice, wrote in an emailed statement.

""We will never close the door on collaboration with other Atlantic provinces, but we are confident our stand-alone model was the right choice for right now.""

Support from police chiefs

The resistance doesn't appear to be coming from municipal police agencies.

CBC News did an informal survey of New Brunswick police forces this week to see if they would support some kind of SIRT in the province. The New Brunswick RCMP referred the question to the provincial Department of Public Safety, but all the municipal police chiefs who answered the survey said they support the idea.

""The [New Brunswick Association of Chiefs of Police] and myself have long supported the concept of an independent investigative body to investigate police. Our support for such a concept remains unchanged,"" Kennebecasis Regional Police Force Chief Wayne Gallant wrote in an email.

""Whether it is a [New Brunswick] only or Atlantic wide, or some other structural concept, the fact remains such a body is needed in [New Brunswick] and has been for a long time.""

Estimated to use SIRT 21 times per year

There's also a clear need for an independent body, given the number of incidents in New Brunswick, according to Ron MacDonald, the former director of Nova Scotia SIRT.

""I believe that the numbers do justify it, especially either for New Brunswick to have their own team or a joint type of team that would permit this type of work to be done on a moment's notice,"" said MacDonald, who is now chief civilian director of the Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia.

Ron MacDonald, the former director of Nova Scotia SIRT, says New Brunswick can't keep relying on other provinces to investigate serious incidents involving police. (Nic Amaya/CBC)

Police chiefs in New Brunswick were asked in 2017 to try to estimate how often they'd use a SIRT if the province had one. It assumed that New Brunswick would use the same criteria as Nova Scotia SIRT, which has a mandate to investigate ""all matters that involve death, serious injury, sexual assault and domestic violence or other matters of significant public interest"" arising from the actions of a police officer.

The police chiefs estimated it could be needed 21 times per year, emails show.

CBC's Deadly Force database, which tracks fatalities where police have used force, shows seven people have been killed by police in New Brunswick between 2010 and the end of June 2020.

That means there are many serious incidents that don't rise to the level of someone losing their life and which aren't often known publicly.

""There can be significant public issues with matters that fall short of shooting cases and when you're only picking and choosing certain ones, that does leave the potential for the public to have concerns about other cases that aren't being investigated by an independent body,"" MacDonald said.

Details of proposed partnership unclear

It's not clear exactly how a New Brunswick-Nova Scotia SIRT partnership would work and whether it means New Brunswick would have its own civilian director or satellite office.

As it stands, sending investigators from another province, without having extra resources or separate legislation, comes with problems, beyond the fact that other provinces may not have the resources to send.

Every time an investigator from Nova Scotia SIRT comes to New Brunswick, they need to be made a peace officer in order to do their work, according to Cacchione.

Nova Scotia SIRT doesn't have the manpower to support New Brunswick without extra resources, according its director, Felix Cacchione. (SIRT)

When they work in New Brunswick, they need the Crown to approve laying criminal charges, an added layer that isn't present in Nova Scotia, where SIRT has the power to lay charges.

It also means a delay in getting investigators on scene, which means a delay in collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses.

2019 review recommended NB develop a SIRT

That came up in a 2019 government-ordered review of the New Brunswick Police Commission, which investigates citizen complaints of officer conduct and other complaints related to policing in the province.

""SIRT investigators must have scenes secured and delays in attending a scene can impact the investigation negatively or unreasonably inconvenience the public,"" wrote Alphonse MacNeil, who authored the review.

MacNeil recommended the government consider developing ""a SIRT entity"" in New Brunswick and suggested a possible model: a two-investigator team that would work in New Brunswick under the direction of Nova Scotia's SIRT director.

It's not clear if that's the model New Brunswick prefers. No one from the Department of Public Safety was made available for an interview for this story, nor was anyone from Nova Scotia's Department of Justice.

""Minister [Carl] Urquhart has recently mentioned an interest in having a permanent independent agency to investigate police use of force, and has spoken about various options, including a regional agency serving more than one province,"" New Brunswick Department of Public Safety spokesperson Coreen Enos wrote in an emailed statement.

""Our discussions with Nova Scotia officials are part of our exploration of various models.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-sirt-policing-oversight-1.5660266?cmp=rss,news,canada,new-brunswick

Baribeau said they started writing songs at the age of 13.

""I have an attachment to each of them for different reasons. Even though I don't feel the same as I did when this project started, I'm proud to be honouring the emotions I felt and the person I was.""

Baribeau recently signed a two-year contract with N'we Jinan records.

""Angel has always been an artist at heart, but has slowly grown into their own voice,"" N'we Jinan's project manager David Hodges said.

25448,2020-07-24 4:00,"River Lions' Muldrow travelled the world for basketball, but feels settled in Canada","Sam Muldrow's passport is almost as full as his stat sheet.

With a professional career spanning nearly a decade, there are few countries where he hasn't made his presence felt. In Greece, he averaged 5.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game, becoming the Greek Basket League's leader in blocks.

His final year with the University of South Carolina Gamecocks earned him SEC Defensive Player of the Year, beating out superstar names like DeMarcus Cousins and Tobias Harris.

Muldrow's athletic abilities have awarded him the opportunity to travel across the globe doing what he loves, but for the past 4 years, it has been Canada that he has called home.

It was never his intention to make a life in Canada. A quick stop, perhaps, on his way to his next destination, but the allure of the Great White North was immediately evident as he touched the tarmac from his most recent stint in Germany.

Niagara by way of Germany

The opportunity to play for the Niagara River Lions did not come courtesy of a scout or agent, but from an opponent in the Basketball Bundesliga ProA league.

Logan Stutz, the NBL's reigning MVP at the time, first took notice of Muldrow's talent while finding himself on the receiving end of the big man's defensive artistry.

Block-by-block and steal-by-steal, Stutz — however frustrated by Muldrow's presence — knew one thing: he was playing against the best, and he wanted to play alongside the best.

A few conversations and a plane ticket later, and Big Sam — as he is affectionately known to teammates and fans alike — was on his way to Niagara to start what would become his new life.

""I played against [Stutz] in Germany and he recommended me to the Niagara River Lions. They gave me a shot and that's how I ended up on the team,"" Muldrow said.

WATCH | What is the Elam Ending?

The CEBL will be back in action this month, but they're using a new method to end games: the Elam Ending. So, what exactly does that mean? 2:45

The River Lions always felt like home to the power forward. While treated well by every team he had played for thus far, the sense of familiarity he felt with Niagara was a sensation he had yet to experience as a professional.

""It's a great organization. They treated me real nice since the first day I got here and I just kind of fell in love,"" he said.

Gone were the days of struggling to learn a new language, only to have to learn another one a season later. He didn't have to worry about the spiders in Australia, adjusting instead to Canadian rules of the road and one dollar coins.

Muldrow bought into the River Lions as both a team and organization. Even after Stutz moved on the following season, Sam remained.

Mutually beneficial relationship

The strength of the relationship between Muldrow and the Niagara River Lions is not one sided. When making the transition from the NBL Canada to the CEBL, president Jeffrey Sotiriou insisted Muldrow be present for the meetings.

""One of the guys who worked for the team brought me into the office with Jeff [Sotiriou] during the NBL, before there even was a CEBL, and asked for my opinion on a summer league,"" Muldrow said. ""[He] asked if I thought guys would play [for the team] during the summer and I was like 'yeah! A lot of guys would ... the rest was history after that.""

Whether by way of his southern charm or what he can do on the court, Sotiriou and the River Lions recognized that Muldrow is the embodiment of their franchise: powerful, courageous, strong and proud.

Muldrow's goal for the 2020 Summer Series echoes that of every other player in the league: to win the championship. The difference being that for Muldrow and Niagara, it is a goal years in the making.

Hoisting the trophy just once isn't good enough for Muldrow, though. His intention past this unprecedented season is to remain in Canada long term.

No longer will he need to contort his six-foot-nine frame into an airplane seat for upwards of 12 hours to return to South Carolina to visit his eight-year-old daughter, Jayla.

""I'm close to home,"" Muldrow said. ""My daughter was born in 2011, so playing in Canada gives me more opportunity see her.""

There is now an opportunity for family and friends to watch his games, and though Canadian winters are more harsh than those of the south, they aren't something he hasn't already adjusted to.

25440,2020-07-24 4:00,"'Illegal assault' on First Nations brothers by police caught on video was racist, lawsuit alleges","Ontario Provincial Police officers allegedly falsified their notes to justify a racially influenced violent takedown of two First Nations brothers in Orillia, Ont., that was caught on cellphone video, according to a lawsuit filed in an Ontario court this week.

The lawsuit, seeking $400,000 in damages, names the Ontario government, two identified OPP officers and a number of unknown officers. It was filed in Toronto on Wednesday.

It alleges that the two officers, acting on a report that a ""Native male"" had fallen off a bicycle, illegally assaulted Randall May, 57, of Nipissing First Nation, and Aaron Keeshig, 50, of Neyaashiinigmiing First Nation.

The lawsuit also alleges that an OPP officer, assigned to investigate a complaint over the incident filed by May, offered to have May's charges dropped if he abandoned the complaint, according to the statement of claim.

The legal action comes at a time of heightened awareness of racial profiling by the police against Black and Indigenous people and amid worldwide protests over recent high-profile incidents of police brutality.

In Canada, two Indigenous people were shot and killed by police in New Brunswick within a span of eight days in June. Chantal Moore, 26, was killed by police in Edmunston during a wellness check at her home while Rodney Levi, 48, of Metepenagiag First Nation, was fatally shot by the RCMP.

The incident involving the OPP in Orillia unfolded in the front yard and driveway of May's home and was captured in cellphone video that was obtained by CBC News.

""In order to justify the illegal assault, detention and arrest, the police falsified police notes, falsely accused both brothers of offences they did not commit and wrongly charged Mr. May of assaulting police,"" said the statement of claim, filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

(Ousama Farag/CBC News)

""Mr. May and Mr. Keeshig, who are both First Nations men, assert that the illegal, violent and entirely unjustified treatment they suffered was the result of racial profiling, racial bias and discrimination.""

The OPP said in a statement it couldn't comment on ongoing litigation.

However, its statement said that the OPP's professional standards bureau investigated the complaint filed by May in February 2019, at the direction of the police watchdog, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD).

The statement said the internal investigation concluded that the allegations were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the findings were relayed by the OIPRD to May. The file was closed in May 2019, the OPP's statement said.

The police force hasn't yet filed a statement of defence because it was just served with the lawsuit.

Lawsuit alleges man was repeatedly Tasered

May told CBC News he doesn't remember ever receiving the results of the investigation from the OIPRD.

The lawsuit claims he suffered the worst during the takedown. He was thrown to the ground, punched and repeatedly Tasered to the point where he lost control of his bodily functions, according to the statement of claim.

""I could hear myself screaming,"" May said in an interview with CBC News outside his home, at the spot where the incident occurred on Sept. 15, 2018.

It was sunny that Saturday evening when May and Keeshig returned on their bicycles from a restaurant to May's home, which sits on a lot surrounded by thick bushes and trees on a dead-end street.

May said he was walking his bicycle and crossing his driveway when he noticed an OPP cruiser pull up and an officer emerge.

""I had no idea what they were doing here,"" he said.

""He grabbed my bike and I said, 'What are you doing? You're on private property.' And he said that he got a complaint [that] some Native man walking down the road fell off his bike.""

Cellphone video shows incident

Cellphone video, recorded by May's relative, Jessie Fancy, captured what happened next.

The video shows one officer, identified as Sgt. Mark Connor, shoving May into the bushes as Keeshig arrived, walking his bike.

Connor then told Keeshig to ""back off"" as May struggled to his feet, according to the video.

Keeshig inched closer and Connor repeated his warning.

""Don't be rough on my bro,"" Keeshig said, according to the video.

Aaron Keeshig, outside his brother Randall May's home near Orillia, Ont., says he knew that if he resisted police, it could have been much worse. (Ousama Farag/CBC News)

Sirens are heard in the background as Connor pushes Keeshig back before turning his attention to May. The sound of a Taser cracks in the air.

A second officer, Const. Andrew Markle, then appeared, grabbed Keeshig by the arm and flipping him to the gravel driveway.

""Get on the ground,"" Markle is heard saying as he pinned Keeshig down and handcuffed him.

Markle then moved to back up Connor, who yelled at May to ""stop resisting"" and ""put your hands behind your back.""

The sound of Taser charges are audible, along with May's screams.

""Now they're punching him,"" Fancy is heard saying on the video.

""Connor continued to shock Mr. May with successive rounds shot from his Taser while Mr. May lay prone and defenceless on the ground.... At least one of the police officers yanked the Taser barbs out of Mr. May's skin before shooting him again,"" the statement of claim said.

""Connor and ... Markle then began to punch Mr. May repeatedly, while one of them yelled 'put your hand behind your back or I will Taser you again!'""

The lawsuit alleges that May was Tasered so many times that he became incontinent.

""They threw me in the back of this car and I guess I was just full of excrement,"" he said.

May said the OPP did not provide him with a change of clothes or any blankets while he was in the holding cell overnight. He was forced to wash his soiled clothes in the toilet bowl, which he couldn't flush, he said.

""I basically slept beside my own excrement,"" May said.

""I guess they were trying to humiliate me.""

Charges withdrawn by the Crown

May was charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, along with two counts under the Liquor Licence Act of being intoxicated in a public place and having open liquor.

His criminal charges were withdrawn by the Crown in November 2018 and his liquor charges were withdrawn in April 2019.

Keeshig faced charges under the Liquor Licence Act of being intoxicated in a public place and having open liquor. He was convicted after an administrative error, but the conviction was overturned in March 2019.

The statement of claim alleges that the officers ""illegally"" detained May and Keeshig, and they never informed either man of the reason for their arrest. The document said the brothers were the victims of ""assault and battery"" at the hands of the officers.

""The force was excessive, unreasonable and not justifiable at law,"" the statement of claim said.

It also alleges that the officers ""falsified their police notes and other official records,"" claiming May was in a fighting stance, put up his fist, was aggressive and pushed Connor.

Aaron Keeshig shows some of the injuries he sustained by the Ontario Provincial Police on Sept. 15, 2018. (Courtesy of Randall May)

""Any resistance to the detention and arrest was passive in nature and was justified in law by the fact that ... Connor had no grounds to arrest or detain Mr. May and therefore had no grounds to use force against him,"" the statement of claim said.

The document alleges that the officers falsely claimed that Keeshig fell off his bike when he arrived at May's home and was carrying an open can of beer. The video clearly shows he was walking his bike when he arrived and was not holding a can of beer, which the statement of claim also alleges.

The officers also falsely alleged that Keeshig tried to interfere with the arrest, according to the statement of claim.

""Keeshig was never anywhere near Mr. May and fully complied with the instructions to stay back,"" said the statement of claim, an assertion largely supported by the cellphone video.

Keeshig said in an interview he knew that if he resisted, it could have been much worse.

""I'd imagine if I would have stood up for myself ... I probably would've got shot, too, maybe not with a Taser gun either, probably a real gun,"" he said.

Officer allegedly offered deal

The statement of claim alleges that after May filed a complaint with the OIPRD about his treatment, the police watchdog asked the OPP to investigate, and the provincial police turned the matter over to its professional standards bureau.

One of the officers assigned to the file then offered May a quid pro quo, the lawsuit claims.

""One OPP officer even went so far as to offer to withdraw Mr. May's criminal charges if he in turn would withdraw the OIPRD complaint,"" the statement of claim said.

The document alleges that the officers assigned to investigate ""began harassing Mr. May and pressuring him to drop the complaint.""

The OIPRD said it couldn't comment due to privacy laws.

25486,2020-07-24 4:00,Canada slots nearly $15M for Nunavut harvesters to improve food security,"The federal government is giving Inuit in Canada over half of a $40-million grant for harvesters, and Nunavut Inuit will see the bulk of those funds.

To support food security through traditional harvesting, Inuit communities will get $28.5 million over the next five years through the federal Harvesters Support Grant. Of that, Nunavut Inuit are getting more than $14.8 million.

The grant is meant to fill a gap in the Nutrition North program, which only covers groceries bought in a store.

Funds, which are available now for self-governments and land claim organizations, could be used to repair hunting equipment, buy outdoor clothing, fund community freezers, or help harvesters get the certifications they need.

It all depends on what communities need to remove the cost barriers Indigenous Canadians face in rural and remote northern communities when harvesting traditional foods, says Northern Affairs Minister Daniel Vandal.

""Each community has unique harvesting needs and priorities,"" he said, following a virtual meeting on Thursday with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.

""There has to be flexibility involved in these agreements. We've made sure that there's enough flexibility to tailor each program,"" he said.

The grant is only available to communities that rely on air transportation for more than eight months every year.

The Makivik Corporation is receiving approximately $7.1 million and the Nunatsiavut government will get about $3.1 million, also over five years.

Other funding allotments within the territories over the coming five years include:

$503,995 for the Tłı̨chǫ government.

$772,485 for the Sahtu Secretariat Inc.

$277,275 to the Vuntut Gwitchin.

$3.4 million to the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation.

Money for other northern communities without land claims organizations will be distributed through band councils and community leadership groups.

Once the five years are up, the government says it is committing to fund the grant at $8 million per year.

Inuit leaders say true food security isn't in a grocery store

In a press release Thursday, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk said over half of all households in the territory face food insecurity.

""The Harvesters Support Grant is a way for the Government of Canada to systemically recognize the valuable role Inuit hunters and harvesters play in the pursuit of a sustainable livelihood in Nunavut,"" Kotierk said.

Data gathered by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami shows that over 65 per cent of Inuit are harvesters.

Natan Obed, president of the national Inuit organization, says the money will get people out on the land, and allow for targeted infrastructure investments for harvesting and food storage.

He applauded the fact that Inuit and the federal government co-developed the program.

""Nutrition North Canada didn't have a component that explicitly considered Inuit self-determination in food security,"" Obed said. ""Community grocery stores, that isn't getting people to complete food security and it also isn't the preference.""

Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is working to complete a national Inuit food security strategy by the fall.

""We recognize how important food security is to the well-being of our communities and the ability for our communities to be healthy,"" he said.

Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, says funding harvesting gives Inuit a say over how to solve food insecurity in their communities. (CBC)

Young hunters work on a solution

Vandal also met virtually on Thursday with young hunters in Arviat, Nunavut, where the Aqqiumavvik Society teaches youth ages eight to 18 skills for harvesting through guidance from experienced hunters and elders.

""It started out as a food security program where we wanted to take youth and teach them traditional values and beliefs around sustainable harvesting,"" said the wellness group's executive director, Kukik Baker.

""[They're] learning how to hunt the animals properly, learning how to butcher and skin properly and bringing back those animals, the furs and the meat, back to their homes so that they could feed their families,"" she said.

They're also learning about the environment.

""We talk about climate change and how that's affecting us and how we are learning to adapt to our environment around us,"" she said.

The young hunters program has had funding through Crown-Indigenous and Northern Relations since 2018.

Baker says this allows the group to do 10-week training courses four times each year.

25447,2020-07-24 4:00,10 reasons to watch the CEBL Summer Series,"The Canadian Elite Basketball League, which held its inaugural season last year, will become the country's first league to resume play Saturday.

Instead of a traditional season, the CEBL Summer Series will be a month-long tournament played in St. Catharines, Ont. CBC Sports will live stream all games.

Here are 10 of the most intriguing storylines to keep tabs on heading into the competition:

Hamilton-Niagara rivalry

The Niagara River Lions won more than half of the end-of-year awards in 2019 — Guillaume Payen-Boucard won Canadian player of the year; Vic Raso, coach of the year; Sam Muldrow, defensive player of the year. Niagara's promising 15-5 season was spoiled with a 104-103 loss Hamilton Honey Badgers in the playoffs, when it combined to miss four free throws and two wide-open threes in the final two minutes.

""We just crumbled under pressure,"" Payen-Boucard said.

Niagara is returning a similar roster from last year. Six players are back, including star Canadians Payen-Boucard and Trae Bell-Haynes.

""The returning guys feel like they have unfinished business,"" Raso said.

Hamilton chose a different direction this season. None of the team's 2019 starters have returned, yet high-level national team players fill the roster, including Justin Jackson, Owen Klassen, Duane Notice,and MiKyle McIntosh. American import Brianté Weber also boasts NBA experience.

The two teams face off in the CEBL's season opener Saturday at 1:30 p.m. ET (CBC TV, CBCSports.ca).

Raptors 905 invasion

Raptors 905 is the affiliate of the Toronto Raptors in the NBA's G League. This year, the 905 will invade CEBL team rosters.

Hamilton added a handful of 905ers, including Notice, McIntosh and Derek Cooke Jr. Hamilton head coach Ryan Schmidt is also an assistant coach with the 905 squad. And the connections don't stop there, as Notice and McIntosh are childhood best friends. Schmidt even coached McIntosh in high school. Those interconnecting histories could help Hamilton quickly reach its peak.

There are other 905ers throughout the CEBL, including Negus Webster-Chan of the defending champion Saskatchewan Rattlers. Guelph Nighthawks head coach Charles Kissi is another 905 assistant. The G League presence ensures NBA eyes will be fixed on CEBL games. It also means the intra-905 competition will be fierce.

Moon hungry for more in 2020

Xavier Moon dominated the CEBL last year. The Edmonton Stingers' 25-year-old guard is one of the league's smoothest shooters and was named league MVP in 2019.

""I came in with no expectations at all,"" Moon admitted.

Moon attended the 905 training camp after the CEBL season, but was ultimately one of the team's final cuts. The nephew of former Raptor Jamario Moon will surely have something to prove whenever he faces a former 905er.

WATCH | What is the Elam Ending?

The CEBL will be back in action this month, but they're using a new method to end games: the Elam Ending. So, what exactly does that mean? 2:45

""I wouldn't say that I'm personally going at [the 905 players], but it's definitely a thought at the back of my mind,"" Moon said.

Moon and his Stingers will face the Honey Badgers on July 29. Hamilton's Weber and Notice are among the best defenders in the league, so this game will be one to watch.

Carleton Ravens enter the CEBL

Among the dozen players and coaches polled, virtually all of them chose the CEBL's newest team — the Ottawa Blackjacks — as pre-season favourites. Former Carleton head coach and current Blackjacks general manager Dave Smart managed to sign five of his collegiate players.

The Ravens have won 15 university championships since 2003 and Ottawa will field several of the school's best players from those championship squads.

Star players like Yasiin Joseph, Phil Scrubb and Thomas Scrubb will suit up for Ottawa. Carleton won every championship between 2011 and 2017, when most Blackjacks players were in university.

Ottawa will now attempt to repeat those winning ways at the pro level.

Phil and Thomas Scrubb

The heart of Ottawa's team will be two of Canada's most celebrated players, Phil and Thomas Scrubb, who make their CEBL debut during the Summer Series. According to Phil, the brothers joined in part so that they could play together.

Phil has played in dozens of games for Team Canada. He is one of three Carleton Ravens basketball players — Ottawa head coach Osvaldo Jeanty is another — to have won the CIS Male Athlete of the Year Award. Phil is an effortless scorer, while older brother Thomas is a hard-nosed defender. Like many Carleton players, they're at their best when playing together.

""I think knowing guys on your team well is important,"" Phil said of Ottawa's advantages in signing so many Carleton players. ""We don't have to worry about team chemistry.""

This may be their first year, but the Blackjacks could steal the show. The Scrubb brothers are the team's biggest reason for optimism.

Canadian player of the year award

Beyond potentially determining the eventual champion, the Scrubbs should also figure into the discussion for the Canadian player of the year award. Phil said he isn't gunning for the honour, but he could be an early betting favourite. The Scrubb brothers already impacted last year's race despite not yet playing in the league.

Reigning winner Payen-Boucard credits his explosive offensive rebounding — he led his team in that category last year despite being a guard – to his time spent as a teammate of the Scrubb brothers at Carleton.

""Honestly, I think I got [my rebounding] from Thomas Scrubb,"" he said. ""He was a guy that I was looking up to ... He's pretty much the guy that will do everything and anything to win.""

There will be others competing to take the award from Guillaume, including Bell-Haynes, Notice, McIntosh and Jackson. With the eruption of Canadian talent in the CEBL, it will require an even better season this year to take home the prize.

Defensive player of the year race

Weber has the most NBA experience of all CEBL players. He's played in 42 NBA games and defence is his calling card. He ranks third all-time on the NCAA steals list following his impressive collegiate career with the VCU Rams.

""[Defence] is probably the biggest part of [my game], for sure,"" Weber said.

As a result, he'll be a front-runner for the defensive player of the year award.

""He's got a track record of, everywhere he's been, being known as the best defensive player,"" Schmidt said. ""From a reputation standpoint, going into the tournament, he's definitely a guy that could potentially be in a position to win that award.""

Niagara's Sam Muldrow won the award last year after averaging a league-best 2.1 blocks per game. But with Weber and Notice together in Hamilton, as well as Thomas Scrubb in Ottawa, the CEBL will be full of athletic defenders in contention for the honour.

Can Saskatchewan repeat?

On paper, Ottawa and Hamilton may sport the most accomplished rosters, but don't count out the defending champions in Saskatchewan. Former Rattler Ryan Ejim will suit up for Niagara, but his younger brother Kenny is joining the reigning title holders. He's a defensive presence who will further add to a Saskatchewan team that relied heavily on its defensive abilities en route to its championship.

""Last year's team was very good defensively,"" head coach Chad Jacobson said. ""That group had a lot of willing defenders. A lot of real tough and physical guys who took a lot of pride in defending.""

Like last season, Saskatchewan may be flying under the radar heading into 2020 and could surprise again.

Best of the West

Saskatchewan and Edmonton were rivals in the West last season. The Stingers finished with a better regular-season record, but Saskatchewan had their number all year. After beating the Stingers in three of four regular season games, the Rattlers dominated again in the playoffs, winning 114-93.

Edmonton bet on continuity for the Summer Series. Canadian Jordan Baker, who is a talented rebounder and passer from the big position, will return. Moon and fellow all-star first team forward Travis Daniels are back, and their chemistry is Edmonton's strongest weapon.

""I was just grateful to have him on my team,"" Moon said of Daniels. ""Once I got on the court with him, man, it made my job a lot easier.""

The Stingers have a true big three in Moon, Daniels and Baker. Edmonton, like Niagara in the East, is out to avenge its playoff exit.

What to expect from Fraser Valley

The Fraser Valley Bandits are perhaps the biggest wild card in the CEBL. They finished 2019 in last place at 4-16. With Marek Klassen as the team's lone returnee — at player or coach — the roster is new and unfamiliar.

Incoming Tavarion Nix plays bigger than his six-foot-seven frame, and he's won championships in leagues around the world. The American is one candidate to pace the team in scoring. Fraser Valley has potential stars, but no one yet knows who will lead the team.

Klassen is an assist maven, leading the league with 7.2 per game last year. His ability to set the table could help his teammates acclimate quickly.

25441,2020-07-24 4:00,Why err on the side of caution as COVID-19 looms in workplaces,"Hospitals, long-term care homes and other workplaces in Canada need to err on the side of caution or risk being paralyzed in the face of uncertainty from COVID-19, some doctors say.

Six months after the country's first presumed case, more than 8,900 devastating deaths have occurred mainly among elders and 98,000 others have recovered. Restrictions to everyday routines curbed transmission and avoided overwhelming health-care systems, but public health officials warn people still need to protect themselves to keep case numbers low.

COVID-19 is a tricky disease. Its symptoms can be absent or vague, its course remains unpredictable to physicians and its exact methods and timing of transmission haven't been nailed down.

Those lingering uncertainties are on Dr. Lauren Crosby's mind as Calgary ramps up day and elective surgeries.

""When you're working in the context of scientific uncertainty, especially in the case of an impending and serious threat to health, it's unreasonable to clarify, to wait for the answers to all your questions before you take action to avert the threat,"" said Crosby, an anesthesia resident in Calgary.

Reassurance of higher-level precautions

That's why Crosby and her father, Dr. Edward Crosby, an anesthesiologist at Ottawa Hospital, wrote an opinion piece last week in the Canadian Journal of Anesthesiology titled ""Applying the precautionary principle to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic: did we learn the lessons of SARS?""

""If we can't be certain then we should be safe,"" she said.

For the Crosbys, one of the lessons from the 44 deaths from SARS in Toronto in 2003 is that when health-care workers are asked to put themselves at risk of infection to care for others, PPE like masks, gowns and gloves should be provided. It's an application of the precautionary principle — the idea of erring on the side of caution to protect public health.

Justice Horace Krever first recommended the precautionary principle during the Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada in 1997.

Justice Archie Campbell's 2006 SARS Commission also called for the health concerns of health-care workers to be taken seriously so they feel safe, even if that requires higher levels of precautions, Crosby said.

If health-care workers become sick with COVID-19, they pose a "" triple threat "" as vectors for more disease transmission, reduced capacity in the health-care system and by becoming patients.

""Scarcity is not a valid reason to limit protective equipment and to limit access to that equipment,"" Crosby said.

Instead, she said, to prepare for a second wave, PPE should be used as efficiently as possible, including decontaminating and repurposing it and using other barriers during procedures that spray infectious aerosols.

Fostering public trust

People working in any industry need to feel involved in decision making and have their concerns addressed, Crosby said. Otherwise, there can be a loss of public trust, low morale, anxiety and confusion. In health-care settings, the stress can lead to burnout of workers who are particularly in demand during the pandemic.

WATCH | Lives remembered in Quebec:

Staff and family laid 101 flowers — one for each of the seniors who lost their lives at CHSLD Sainte-Dorothée in Laval, the Quebec long-term care home hit hardest by COVID-19. 1:17

Dr. Roger Wong, a clinical professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia, called the idea of applying the precautionary principle an important and timely conversation because COVID-19 has already hit long-term care homes and other shared living facilities hard.

""We have an opportunity, a very narrow window,"" Wong said in an interview. ""We should take action now.""

How? Wong told a Senate committee reviewing the government's response to COVID-19 that he'd like to see systemic changes, such as including long-term care within the Canada Health Act.

The federal government is well positioned to set standards in areas like collecting physical and mental health outcome data, including social isolation and loneliness. Then, the data can drive policy change and better protect those who are most vulnerable, Wong said.

Wong was also involved in updating the federal government's COVID-19 guidance for long-term care homes.

Be transparent as evidence evolves

Tim Caulfield, Canada research chair in health law and policy, supports applying the precautionary principle.

He said it has an intuitive appeal. During COVID-19, it's been raised in the context of wearing masks and weighing the use of pharmaceutical treatments like hydroxychloroquine.

""If you're going to do that, then you have to take extra care to ensure that you're being transparent about the information that you're using, the evidence you're using to make the decision,"" Caulfield said. ""You want to make sure that you are open to change as the evidence evolves.""

He pointed to an association between jurisdictions around the world, such as Australia and regions of France, which have been the most successful in containing the disease so far, and public trust in key institutions and decision makers.

""In the face of uncertainty, we still have to march forward and we have to do it in a manner that benefits the most, and I think that we can't allow uncertainty to paralyze us,"" Caulfield said.

(CBC News)

Dr. Timothy Paul Hanna, a clinician and scientist at Queen's University Cancer Research Institute, applied the precautionary principle to help guide Ontario's prioritization plans for cancer care during COVID-19.

Potential risks to patients include:

Infection risk by leaving their homes to come for treatment.

Possible side-effects of treatment, such as radiation for lung cancer that further diminishes lung function after getting COVID-19.

Treatment and diagnostic delays associated with rationing care when hospitals scale back.

""We're really fortunate across Canada,"" Hanna said. 'We weren't left as single institutions or single physicians to proceed based on our own opinion when resources became limited. I think that that's a real plus of our universal health-care system.""

Provincial prioritization frameworks weighed factors he wrote about such as the magnitude of benefit from treatment, if the treatment is meant to be curative or palliative, patient considerations such as age, comorbidity, and preferences as well as the availability of human resources and equipment to treat cancers.

Canada has a narrow window of opportunity to better protect its most vulnerable, says Dr. Roger Wong. (Submitted by UBC)

""Regardless of how we discover how well we might have done, I think the mental health effects and social stress, the impacts on patients and their families having to wait or having to experience care in maybe a different way, like through telemedicine or other virtual means, I'm sure we'll find has been hard on patients.""

Canadians are touched not only as patients, but as employees and citizens, too.

Soma Ray-Ellis, chair of the employment group at Gardiner Roberts LLP in Toronto, said that as non-essential employees return to work and social gatherings occur, more direction is needed on applying precautionary principles together with human rights, occupational health and safety and privacy legislations.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/precautionary-principle-covid-work-1.5660804?cmp=rss,news,health,
25442,2020-07-24 4:00,Saskatchewan family travelling to B.C. to spread parents' ashes alerts community ahead of arrival,"The Switzer sisters want residents of Prince Rupert, B.C., to know they are driving to B.C. from Alberta and Saskatchewan this week to spread their parents' ashes.

Their mother died a few years ago, and her father passed away this past January. Dallas and Shirley wanted to visit the city to spread ashes in March, but they put those plans on hold when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

After hearing stories about British Columbians vandalizing vehicles and leaving nasty notes on windshields of cars with out-of-province licence plates, the sisters became increasingly concerned about their presence in B.C.. So, in preparation for the trip, they shared their travel plans with residents on a community Facebook page for their parents' hometown.

""Just to let y'all know I'm from Saskatchewan I will be there in less than a week,"" Dallas Switzer's post said. It went on to explain she would be with her family of nine with out-of province licence plates, that they have been tested for COVID-19, and that they would wear masks in public areas.

Since the pandemic began, Albertan visitors, and even British Columbia residents who have out-of-province licence plates, have returned to their parked vehicles in B.C. towns to find messages telling them they're not welcome.

B.C.'s provincial health officer has reminded residents multiple times to be kind to everyone, regardless of what their license plates indicate, because there's no way to know why they're in B.C..

Some Albertans feel singled out

But even with reminders from provincial leaders, some Albertans still feel singled out.

Debi Bert has just gone home to Edmonton after a stay at her sister's condo in Kelowna. She says she tried to keep a low profile during her time there. On one of the few occasions she ventured out in her car, which has an Alberta licence plate, she received a note on her windshield telling her to go home.

""I was grateful that our car wasn't keyed or something like that,"" she said.

Debi Bert found this note on her car, which has Alberta licence plates, after visiting a mall in Kelowna, B.C. (Submitted by Debi Bert)

She too had heard of the animosity Albertans had faced in B.C. before her visit.

Bert was disappointed to see other people in Kelowna not observing physical distancing guidelines or wearing non-medical face masks, which she said has become commonplace in Alberta.

""I'm happy to be going home because I think I think [Albertans] are taking it more seriously,"" she said.

""I don't mean to bash B.C., because I'm telling you, it is a beautiful province, but I just hope that they can somehow manage to pull it together and knock it off and get through this together and strong and not see their numbers continue to go up.""

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C. have been climbing steadily, and leaders have been raising concerns about large gatherings.

During a Thursday press briefing, B.C. Premier John Horgan specifically pointed to parties in Kelowna that has resulted in a cluster of confirmed COVID-19 cases and a drum circle in Vancouver that drew criticism online.

""Come on. You're better than that. We need bigger spaces and fewer faces,"" he said.

Notes of support for Switzer family

When Switzer posted her family's plans on Facebook, she received several responses, all very supportive.

""I kind of was [surprised] considering the other posts I'd seen about out of towners, like they weren't necessarily mean or using swear words, but they were not happy,"" she said.

25444,2020-07-24 4:00,Is it time for a woman to lead the Canadian military?,"One of Ottawa's favourite parlour games is about to begin anew.

It's called Spot the Next CDS (Chief of the Defence Staff).

The planned retirement of Gen. Jonathan Vance, announced Thursday, has set political and defence establishment tongues wagging, even though his departure has been widely rumoured, signalled and even expected.

It is also no secret that the Liberal government, to further burnish its progressive credentials, would sorely like to appoint a woman to head the institution long considered the bastion of masculinity.

It may certainly be time, but the government faces a conundrum in that there are less than a handful of women with the right rank and experience.

A larger, equally impressive cohort, is on the way up through the ranks.

But among the current crop, Lt.-Gen. Christine Whitecross is already on the way out the door to retirement. And the other, Lt.-Gen. Frances Allen, is a relatively unknown quality outside of the Department of National Defence and in international military circles, where connections are all-important.

Whitecross, a well-regarded, tough-minded officer, has long been thought to be in the running to replace Vance after her stint at the NATO Defence College in Italy was over.

""I can't recall too many of the other service chiefs popping up in the PM's Twitter feed,"" said defence analyst Dave Perry.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has congratulated Whitecross at least twice on social media — when she assumed command at the NATO college in 2016, and last week upon word of her retirement, when he praised her dedication to gender equality.

Perry also noted that other military officers have been coaxed out of retirement to take the top job: ""So, I wouldn't rule her out entirely.""

Perry concedes that reading the tea leaves based on the prime minister's Twitter account may seem like a ""glib assessment,"" but he suggests that social media is often a strong indicator of priorities with this government.

Most of the other major service chiefs, including newly appointed Vice Chief of the Defence Staff Mike Rouleau, the commander of the air force, Lt.-Gen. Al Meinzinger, and navy commander Vice-Admiral Art McDonald are also thought to be among the interested candidates.

Institutional, political challenges

Whoever takes over will face many of the same institutional and political challenges which have vexed the current inhabitant of the top commander's suite.

Among the demands the new defence chief will face will be continually underlining the relevance of the Canadian Armed Forces to a government that occasionally seems disinterested even as the world becomes more unstable.

Vance, who has served five years in the defence chief's job, had been considered a potential candidate to lead NATO's Military Committee, but the Liberal government refused to put his name forward for consideration.

There are a number of different factors that go into a decision like that, including personal relationships between the government and the defence chief, said Perry, a vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.

""More broadly, getting a country's nominated candidate into that job requires the spending of political capital,"" he said. ""You have to basically convince other countries to take your guy or gal. And I've never taken NATO to be part of this government's core branding. It's not like the United Nations. I've had a hard time thinking this government would expend that kind of political capital.""

Most of Vance's legacy, according to Perry, is tied up in the reforms he attempted to undertake within the military, including Operation Honour, the effort to stamp out sexual misconduct within the ranks, and the more recent drive to eliminate racist behaviour.

Retired lieutenant-general Guy Thibault, who was Vance's first vice chief of the defence staff before retiring four years ago, said the social challenges his former boss faced were greater than what some of his predecessors contended with, and he tried to deal with them head-on.

The military was — when Vance took over in 2015 — in the grip of a full-blown crisis over sexual assaults and harassment. A landmark report by former supreme court justice Marie Deschamps had exposed a toxic culture and a willingness of senior leaders to dismiss and even look the other way.

As his first major decision Vance launched a campaign of reform and accountability structured as a military operation, with defined objectives and outcomes.

The intervening years have seen a flood of sexual assault and misconduct charges and routine assessments of the culture.

Operation Honour has met with mixed success, even in Vance's estimation, when he noted in an interview Thursday with CBC News that changing the culture of the military, as an institution, was a lot harder than he had anticipated.

The data being produced by the defence department shows the needle has moved only slightly in terms of both the perception of misconduct within the military and the number of reported incidents.

Both Thibault and Perry said it will take ""a generation"" to produce the kind of change Vance was seeking within the span of five years.

""I don't think anyone could have done better under the circumstances,"" said Thibault, who now heads the Conference of Defence Associations Institute. ""He's a hard-charger and tough minded.""

Those qualities undoubtedly made him enemies, both inside and outside of the bureaucracy, particularly when it came to the suspension of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, Thibault's successor as vice chief of the defence staff.

Norman was charged with one count of breach of trust after the RCMP and the Crown accused him of leaking cabinet secrets related to a shipbuilding deal.

Critics within the military and political world have said Vance did not do enough to protect his deputy from what turned out to be a failed prosecution.

Thibault said he believed much of the case was ""outside of Gen. Vance's hands"" and that RCMP was more in control of events.

History, however, will be the judge.

Vance said Thursday he has no interest in writing a memoir and insisted he is ""more than good"" with the government's decision to pass on the NATO nomination.

In turning down several television interview requests on Thursday, the outgoing defence chief displayed the determination of many old soldiers to quietly fade away.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vance-defence-chief-replacements-1.5661292?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25446,2020-07-24 4:00,How medical assistance in dying law has affected my family: A caregiver's perspective,"This column is an opinion by Jason LeBlanc, an independent MAID researcher and advocate for fair medical assistance in dying (MAID) laws. His partner has applied for a medically assisted death three times. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.

Accessibility issues around medical assistance in dying in Canada are often spoken about within the parameters of ""slippery slopes,"" bioethical arguments with no clear answer given, and the discriminatory unfairness currently upheld by MAID legislation.

What often gets forgotten is that MAID isn't about hypothetical cases in an academic debate, it's about people. Real people who are suffering.

Chapter 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms states, ""Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.""

In other words, every Canadian has control over their own life.

In this spirit, you have the right to make decisions on your health, medical care, and bodily integrity. When a Canadian is compelled to take their life through violent, unpredictable, and dangerous means, because the government refuses to allow them the control and choice of a medically assisted death, it is a violation of those Charter guarantees.

The current federal MAID legislation was ruled unconstitutional last year because of restrictions it placed on eligibility, and on Feb. 24 this year the government tabled proposed amendments. While they expand eligibility to a small degree, the changes still fall short of the mark for many Canadians.

The federal government has unveiled its plans to expand access to medically assisted dying after public consultations. 2:01

My family is one that has been affected directly as a result of the government restricting MAID access to a select few. I am a caregiver to a wonderful woman, my common-law partner, who has been attempting to access a medically assisted death for more than two years now.

The restrictions put into the original Bill C-14 and not properly addressed in the proposed Bill C-7 have made it an absolute hell for her in terms of trying to have her Charter rights respected.

With the help of Dying with Dignity and Ontario's care co-ordination service, she has received three independent assessments. She has fulfilled the entirety of the MAID criteria with the exception of not having a ""reasonably foreseeable death,"" however one chooses to define that term.

Of course, under Bill C-7's proposed amendments, an applicant no longer has to be facing a reasonably foreseeable death to apply for MAID. But this doesn't inherently mean that it will be a simple, straightforward process to qualify. As the Department of Justice puts it: ""While 'reasonable foreseeability of natural death' is removed as an eligibility criterion in the proposed legislation, it is kept as a way of deciding which procedural safeguards will be applied to MAID requests.""

My partner's diagnosis is treatment-resistant fibromyalgia, an often poorly understood form of chronic pain involving a cluster of symptoms that affect the whole body outwards from the central nervous system. Despite the fact that her pain is unrelenting, constant, intolerable, and irremediable, her diagnosis does not put her on track to a naturally shortened life span.

It is this factor that has excluded her from MAID for more than two years.

Minister of Justice and Attorney General David Lametti explains who can perform an expert assessment for medical assistance in dying. (The MAID town hall was recorded March 5, 2020.) 0:49

For years we've done everything possible to improve her quality of life and to control her pain. She's tried over 30 medications, undergone extensive hospital testing, tried various forms of physiotherapy as well as non-traditional medicines and therapies, and been seen by five independent pain specialists.

The decision that was arrived at, to seek MAID, is not emotional, unreasonable, or lacking in proper mental capacity in any way.

The amendments in Bill C-7 would potentially allow her access to a medically assisted death, but under a new set of conditions. Instead of empowering Canadians to have the autonomy to make their choice, the power – nearly all of it – still lies in the hands of assessors, providers and practitioners.

One of the two independent MAID assessors who determines eligibility must have expertise in the condition that's causing the person's suffering. I am thankful we don't live in a rural community where little specialized expertise exists or where access to it is subject to a waiting period of months or years. But even so, it's still unclear whether such an expert exists for my partner's specific condition and/or how that expert's personal feelings about MAID might influence such a decision.

Under Bill C-7, there is also now a minimum of 90 days for the assessment of a MAID request. Justice Minister David Lametti refers to this not as a ""period of reflection,"" as it was called under the existing law, but rather a ""period of assessment."" Regardless of what it's called, this means a longer wait. Before, the ""reflection period"" was only 10 days.

Under the amended legislation my partner fulfills a criteria that will on one hand deem her suffering ""intolerable,"" and on the other, ask her to tolerate said suffering for at least another three months — with the potential outcome that she'll still be denied MAID at the end of the assessment period. A cruel reward.

Minister of Justice and Attorney General David Lametti explains why the 90-day period mandated by the government for MAID is one of assessment, and not a period of waiting. (The MAID town hall was recorded March 5, 2020.) 0:55

As a caregiver, I am left here to watch.

I am powerless. I cannot cure her pain, nor can I stop her suffering. I hear her demands for MAID, but I cannot provide her with assistance in death. I also do not have any answers about why the government believes it is their decision — and not hers — that she continue living despite it being clearly against her will.

It has been a very, very long couple of years waiting for the government to advance, converse, and evolve on this legislation. The government's rules on MAID have left her to suffer, for suffering's sake. It is by miracle of her own strength and sheer determination that she is still here, and that I have not woken up one morning to discover that she's attempted to take her own life.

In statements made to the media, I see our federal Justice Minister David Lametti and Health Minister Patty Hadju continue to use terms like ""safeguards"" to hide restrictions and ""respect of individual autonomy"" to hide exclusion. They say, ""protect the vulnerable.""

To this, I say my common-law partner is the most vulnerable person I know. Look at what the government has done to her. The trauma they have forced her to endure is nearly unforgivable.

Canadians put their questions about MAID to the experts, including Federal Justice Minister, David Lametti. Hosted by The National’s Andrew Chang. 44:27

My experience is not unique. Many Canadian families are facing the same dynamics. There are cases of Canadians who have died by suicide after being denied a medically assisted death. These are stories that do not fit into the narrative the government has positioned around medical assistance in dying.

The undignified manner of these deaths is entirely avoidable, and these are only some of the cases we know about. How many have suffered, and are still suffering silently, is unclear.

From disabled Canadians wanting MAID access, to people with chronic pain, to those suffering with treatment-resistant depression and other forms of mental illness, the government's message with the Bill C-7 amendments is, ""We know better and we aren't willing to grant you the autonomy to make your own choice.""

This brings us back to the Charter, Chapter 7, and the right to life, liberty, and security. I don't remember seeing anywhere that Chapter 7 was optional. Why does the government think so?

The government and MPs on all sides have shown a lack of leadership on this issue, and seemingly refuse to acknowledge the consequences of their vote on MAID for those who are suffering.

The Quebec court decision that motivated the introduction of Bill C-7 was rendered in September of last year. The most recent extension provided by the Quebec Superior Court to revise the existing MAID policies has provided the government with a new deadline of Dec. 18, 2020. This is the second such extension, and will mark 15 months since the original court decision with no change produced as of yet.

As the government moves forward with the proposed MAID amendments and with no details on re-scheduling the parliamentary review that was originally planned for June, this speaks volumes for how our government views revising medical assistance in dying.

It is imperative that our elected officials consider the impact their restrictions, which they've falsely maintained are fair and balanced, have on real Canadians. Legislation carries with it consequences, and the failures of the last government's attempt at equitable MAID cannot be repeated.

This is Canada's opportunity to fix MAID. My family and others are watching intently.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-assisted-dying-maid-legislation-1.5488169?cmp=rss,news,opinion,
25449,2020-07-24 4:00,Young Canucks could benefit from limited media access in NHL bubbles,"Fans won't be the only thing missing from arenas when the NHL begins its Stanley Cup tournament next month in Edmonton and Toronto.

To adhere to the league's COVID-19 protocols, only select media will be allowed into buildings to watch games and there will be no direct access to coaches or players.

Reporters will not be allowed into dressing rooms. That means no face-to-face interviews with players after games and no locker-room scrums following practices. All coach and player availability will be virtual and coordinated by the NHL.

Vancouver goaltender Jacob Markstrom said it's nothing personal, but not having reporters in the dressing room will be a good thing for the young Canucks.

Speaking on a video conference call, Markstrom said he already has seen the difference during training camp as his Canucks prepare for their play-in series against the Minnesota Wild.

""It's for sure a lot different than it could have been, especially in a Canadian market,"" said Markstrom, who is usually cordial but often blunt in talking with reporters. ""In previous years, when you've been in the playoffs, the locker room is pretty much full of media. We're not going to have that right now.

""That's going to be good for our team. Nothing against you guys [but] it makes it a little bit easier for a lot of young players who have never been in playoff games that play for us.""

At least nine Canucks, including Markstrom, Calder Trophy finalist Quinn Hughes, last year's top rookie Elias Pettersson and Brock Boeser have not played a post-season game.

Markstrom was a rookie with the Florida Panthers when they lost in the opening round of the playoffs to the New Jersey Devils, but he didn't see any action.

Boeser said not dealing with a wave of tape recorders and television cameras flooding into the dressing room after a game will be part of the new normal for the return of hockey.

""Not seeing you guys after games will be a little different,"" he said. ""I think we'll probably get out of the rink a little faster.

""We just have to focus on our game. I think that sometimes there are distractions out in the world. This bubble will help throw those aside and help us focus better.""

Boeser dealt with one of those distractions just as training camp opened when a report surfaced in the local media that the Canucks were considering trading him.

Vancouver general manager Jim Benning adamantly denied the suggestion, saying ""someone made that up,"" but Boeser was left frustrated.

""I felt I have always been pretty honest with the media,"" he said. ""I think it was pretty unnecessary.""

Pettersson sometimes looks uncomfortable in large scrums, but the 21-year-old Swede has adapted to being in the spotlight. In small groups, or one-on-one, he can be chatty and has a quirky sense of humour.

""It's different for you guys,"" Pettersson said. ""It's new for everyone. It is what it is, we just have to do the best.""

Depending on the day, head coach Travis Green can be curt, secretive, funny, defensive, informative or dismissive when answering questions. He chuckled when if he was happy reporters wouldn't be interrogating his players.

""Happy or unhappy isn't the word,"" he said. ""I talked to our group about being adaptable and staying focused. This is just part of the new norm. I'm not overthinking it.""

While players may appreciate the new privacy of their dressing room, they are still coming to grips with the idea of playing before empty seats.

""Fans make the game so much more exciting, they bring so much energy,"" said Pettersson.

Not having fan noise can make it easier to hear what players are saying on the ice. Canucks captain Bo Horvat was recently heard sharply criticizing Jake Virtanen after throwing a late hit during a scrimmage.

25503,2020-07-24 4:00,Why this Sudbury woman is making masks from turtle shells and birch bark,"When Sheryl Boivin puts her handmade face mask on, created from unlikely, found objects such as turtle shells, she says she feels protected.

For the last several weeks, the Indigenous artist of Métis and Wendat descent has been spending her nights crafting masks, after returning home from her day job as a health care worker in Sudbury.

In addition to her mask being made from turtle shells shed by their previous owners, Boivin also decided to craft a leather medicine pouch inside it.

Boivin isn't sure the masks are functional in keeping COVID-19 at bay. But she said she's viewing them as pieces of art, in part, expressing her journey as a health worker navigating unprecedented times.

'Added protection'

""Working in health care, there's a certain level of anxiety that goes with working in the hospital setting,"" she said.

""So when I was thinking of the turtle ... the turtle protects you, and adding the medicine pouch is also an added protection.""

Boivin's turtle mask, in particular, is part of a larger initiative called Breathe, which aims to cultivate community and healing during the pandemic through the art of mask-making. (Sheryl Boivin/Facebook)

As a health care worker, Boivin said she spends a large part of her days concerned over the physical wellbeing of people.

In making her turtle mask, she wanted to shift the focus from physical to spiritual wellbeing.

""We're faced with this on a daily basis,"" she said, ""It's not something we can forget about.""

""So the mask is kind of to me, even when I put it on just for show, it feels safe. It feels like a safe place for me.""

Community and healing

Boivin's turtle mask, in particular, is part of a larger initiative called Breathe, which aims to cultivate community and healing during the pandemic through the art of mask-making.

Pom poms, hide, woven cedar, embroidered textiles, copper and carved stone are just some of the materials which have been used by artists across the U.S. and Canada to make the masks that populate the project's Facebook page.

Honouring Indigenous roots

Many are beaded in the traditional Métis style, while others have been crafted using an array of historical and contemporary motifs and techniques.

She said using found objects like shards of turtle shell also helps to deepen and honour her connection with her Indigenous ancestry.

""The turtle is representational of Turtle Island, which is where we live, and it's also a protector of women. And I thought well that really goes in keeping with Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls.""

Inside her turtle mask, Boivin sewed a medicine pouch to offer further protection to the person wearing it. (Sheryl Boivin/Facebook)

Boivin said it took her between three to four weeks to finish her turtle mask.

Now, she said the plan is to continue to make more masks beyond the Breathe project.

She said she's already in the midst of fashioning another mask — this time made from birch bark and moose hair.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/sudbury-turtle-shell-masks-breathe-project-1.5660723?cmp=rss,news,canada,sudbury
25543,2020-07-24 2:52,Hong Kong residents eye immigrating to Canada as new security law comes into effect,"As China's new national security law for Hong Kong brings new restrictions to the semi-autonomous region, some Hong Kong residents are looking to emigrate — and Canada could be a popular option.

The security law came into effect on July 1, after months of protests and violent clashes between pro-democracy organizers and police.

It gives China more authority over the administration of Hong Kong, and among other things, the law makes secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities illegal and bans foreign intervention into the regions' affairs.

Critics have called the law draconian and have expressed concern about its sweeping broadness and the severity of the stipulated punishment which ranges from three years up to life in prison.

Some in Hong Kong are looking to emigrate as a result.

There have been historic waves of emigration out of Hong Kong before, notably after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the U.K. to China.

Canada, and Vancouver in particular, was a popular destination.

Ken Tin Lok Wong, a registered immigration consultant with a Richmond, B.C., law firm, says while there's always been interest and an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong, things have escalated lately.

""We are receiving a gargantuan amount of clients wanting to immigrate to Canada,"" Wong told host Gloria Macarenko on CBC's On The Coast.

Wong said Canada's strong connections to Hong Kong — nearly 300,000 ex-pat Canadians live in Hong Kong and Canada has the second largest Hong Kong diaspora after the U.S. — and its familiarity as an English-speaking Commonwealth country with good education systems and economic opportunity make it a popular choice for Hong Kong residents.

Those coming from Hong Kong would likely apply under the express entry or provincial-level skills immigration programs, where age, education, language proficiency and previous Canadian work experience would be important considerations.

Other countries like Australia and the United Kingdom have been setting up Hong Kong-specific immigration policies that could allow residents an easier path to residency and citizenship — a move that has earned China's ire.

Beijing says the move is a breach of a British pledge and promised unspecified 'corresponding measures.' 2:47

Wong says he doesn't foresee a similar stream for Hong Kong residents in Canada — at least, not yet.

""[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada] does not want to give off the impression that we're assisting, or giving extra leeway, to those who are from Hong Kong,"" he said.

""But then, things can change quickly ... the situation over in Hong Kong is changing almost every day.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hong-kong-canadian-immigration-1.5661164,news,canada,british-columbia
25438,2020-07-24 2:23,Sudan finds mass grave likely linked to foiled 1990 coup,"Sudanese authorities have found a mass grave believed to contain the bodies of 28 army officers shot in a foiled coup attempt against former President Omar al-Bashir in 1990, the public prosecutor said late Thursday.

It was the second Bashir-era mass grave uncovered in as many months.

Al-Bashir's repressive rule collapsed last year, when the military ousted him after months of street protests.

The transitional government, jointly led by civilians and army generals, is navigating a fraught path toward democratic elections and trying to hold al-Bashir's government accountable for crimes committed over the 30 years that he ruled Sudan with an iron fist.

""Evidence indicates that the mass grave is most likely where the bodies of the officers lay who were killed and buried in a ruthless manner,"" said the public prosecutor statement. A team of 23 experts took three weeks to identify and uncover the site, which remains heavily guarded, it added.

There was no immediate comment from al-Bashir's defence lawyers.

The 28 officers who sought to overthrow al-Bashir were arrested and executed in murky circumstances in the spring of 1990. Al-Bashir had been a little-known general when he vaulted to power in a military-backed Islamist coup the year before, toppling the democratically elected government.

Al-Bashir, 76, who is already imprisoned for corruption and facing several other trials, appeared in court earlier this week over charges of plotting the bloodless 1989 coup that brought him to power. The trial is seen as a rare attempt at historical reckoning in Sudan, long convulsed by military coups, tumultuous party politics and civil strife.

In the decades that followed, the government hosted Osama bin Laden, among other militants, rolled back personal freedoms, oversaw a bloody counterinsurgency campaign in the western Darfur region and brutally quashed protests.

ICC has sought al-Bashir's arrest

The discovery of two mass graves, the one found earlier holding the bodies of student conscripts shot or beaten to death after trying to flee a military camp, were a reminder of the scale of alleged human rights violations during al-Bashir's rule.

""Such crimes will not pass without a fair trial,"" the public prosecutor said, addressing the families of victims.

Transitional authorities' attempts to dismantle al-Bashir's legacy and call former officials to account have faced considerable headwinds, with the military retaining control over key portfolios.

The International Criminal Court has sought to arrest al-Bashir on charges of war crimes and genocide linked to the Darfur conflict in the 2000s, when the government launched a scorched-earth assault of aerial bombings and unleashed militias known as the Janjaweed, who are accused of mass killings and rapes.

Sudan's transitional authorities announced earlier this year they had agreed to send al-Bashir to the ICC at The Hague, but have not acted on the decision.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sudan-mass-grave-al-bashir-1.5661434?cmp=rss,news,world,
25434,2020-07-24 1:17,China tells U.S. to close consulate in Chengdu in growing spat,"China ordered the United States on Friday to close its consulate in the western city of Chengdu, ratcheting up a diplomatic conflict at a time when relations have sunk to their lowest level in decades.

The move was a response to the Trump administration's order this week for Beijing to close its consulate in Houston after Washington accused Chinese agents of trying to steal medical and other research in Texas.

The Chinese foreign ministry appealed to Washington to reverse its ""wrong decision.""

Chinese-U.S. relations have soured amid a mounting array of conflicts including trade, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, technology, spying accusations, Hong Kong and allegations of abuses against Chinese ethnic Muslims.

""The measure taken by China is a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the United States,"" said a foreign ministry statement.

""The current situation in Chinese-U.S. relations is not what China desires to see. The United States is responsible for all this,"" the ministry said. ""We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.""

On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.

The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as ""malicious slander"" and warned the Houston consulate's closure was ""breaking down the bridge of friendship"" between the two countries.

25516,2020-07-23 23:40,"Officer who fatally shot Ejaz Choudry refuses to speak with investigators, police watchdog says","The police officer who fatally shot Ejaz Choudry, a 62-year-old man suffering from a mental health crisis, has refused to speak with Ontario's police watchdog about his actions last month.

The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) says the Peel Regional Police officer, whose name has not been released, declined to be interviewed and has also chosen not to submit a copy of his notes.

Under the Police Services Act, officers under investigation, referred to as ""subject officers,"" cannot be legally compelled to speak with the SIU, the agency said in a news release Thursday afternoon.

The Choudry family's lawyer said it's ""troubling but not surprising"" that the officer won't speak with the SIU.

""There is nothing he could possibly say that could excuse or justify shooting Ejaz,"" said Nader Hasan.

Hasan added that he and the family learned about the subject officer's refusal to participate in an interview through media reports Thursday, and criticized the SIU for ""attempting to normalize"" the officer's lack of cooperation.

""We were not given any kind of a heads up,"" he said.

The officer's refusal marks the third case to come to light in recent weeks in which subject officers have chosen not to speak with the watchdog. CBC News revealed Wednesday that two officers from Peel Region involved in the fatal Tasering of Clive Mensah also refused.

Last month, the SIU also indicated the Peel police officer who fatally shot D'Andre Campbell had declined an interview.

All three cases involve Black people or people of colour whose families say they were struggling with mental health issues.

Debate about officers' rights

In SIU investigations, subject officers are treated essentially the same as suspects in a criminal investigation. As such, they share the same charter rights as any other member of the public, including the right not to incriminate themselves.

However, the recent cases have sparked debate about whether police officers should be compelled to speak with investigators.

""No one is holding their breath waiting for this SIU investigation,"" Hasan said. ""We know that they're a paper tiger with a very poor track record. I hope they prove me wrong, but things like today's press release do not inspire confidence.""

In 2019, the SIU filed charges against 15 officers in 13 out of 363 closed cases, amounting to a 3.6 per cent charge rate. The year before, criminal charges were laid against 17 officers in 15 out of 416 cases, again accounting for 3.6 per cent.

Choudry's family said he suffered from schizophrenia and various other medical conditions, and that they had called a non-emergency line with concerns that he wasn't taking his medication.

When paramedics arrived, his nephew, Hassan Choudhary, previously told CBC News, they spotted his uncle's pocketknife — something he kept with him because he felt police ""were out to get him.""

Choudry told family members he wanted to kill himself, according to Choudhary, but no mobile crisis unit was deployed to the home.

Instead, police have said they used a Taser and plastic bullets on Choudry, and opened fire when those had no effect.

Choudry died at the scene.

Investigation ongoing

The SIU says it has completed its fieldwork on the case but that the investigation remains open ""pending receipt of additional information.""

So far, the agency says it has interviewed nine witness officers, an unspecified number of civilian witnesses and has obtained video footage.

The SIU has not yet interviewed Choudry's family members, saying it is awaiting a decision on their scheduling.

On that point, Hasan told CBC News that it was ""outlandish"" for the agency to say it was waiting for the family, adding he has repeatedly told the agency the family wants to participate in the process.

The agency also says it has requested that the family sign a medical release so that investigators can access Choudry's medical records.

Investigators have collected a police-issued firearm, a stun gun and an anti-riot weapon that fires plastic bullets.

They have also collected a knife from the scene. The knife and firearm have been sent for forensic analysis.

An autopsy was conducted on June 22. The SIU says it is awaiting the results of both the post-mortem and toxicology examinations.

25427,2020-07-23 21:55,"Meghan, Prince Harry sue over photo of son taken at their L.A. home","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle sued Thursday to stop the sale and publication of a photo of their son Archie that they say was shot at their Los Angeles-area home in invasion of their privacy.

The royal couple gives a detailed account in the lawsuit of the media harassment they say they've had to constantly fight in the months since they moved to Southern California.

""This action arises out of the relentless and quite frankly shocking efforts of the tabloid media to profit from serial intrusions of the privacy of a 14-month-old child in his own home,"" the suit says, ""and the desire and responsibility of any parent to do what is necessary to protect their children from this manufactured feeding frenzy.""

Meghan and Harry said the tabloid harassment finally came to a head when they saw that a photo of Archie was being offered to media outlets that was purportedly taken on a family outing in Malibu, when in fact it was clearly shot while he was in their yard, unbeknownst to them.

""Archie has not been in public, much less in Malibu, since the family arrived here,"" the lawsuit says.

It alleges the picture is mislabeled because the sellers knew it would be unlawful for them to sell a photograph of a child in his own home.

The couple has not learned the identity of the shooters and sellers of the photos, who are listed as John Does in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. The plaintiffs are listed as Harry, The Duke of Sussex and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex. The lawsuit seeks to identify the defendants, and for the court to issue injunctions requiring them to turn over all photos of Archie and cease harassing the family.

The lawsuit says the family was forced to erect a large mesh fence to block photographers with telephoto lenses from shooting pictures of them from a ridge hundreds of yards away from the home of a friend in a gated community where they have been living.

That led to the appearance of drones that flew as close as six metres above their home, as often as three times a day, in attempts to get photos, the suit says. Helicopters have flown over as early as 5:30 a.m. local time, waking Archie and neighbours, and some photographers have cut holes in their mesh fence attempting to get shots of them.

Couple left U.K. over media spotlight

Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and sixth in line to the British throne, married Meghan Markle, an American actress who grew up in Los Angeles, at Windsor Castle in 2018, in a posh ceremony watched around the world.

In January, the couple announced they planned to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America. The split became official at the end of March.

The couple chose to live at least part-time in North America ""to escape the incessant U.K. tabloid fabrications,"" the lawsuit says. Meghan is also suing a pair of media outlets there for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.

They were able to live quietly in North Saanich, B.C., for six weeks, the lawsuit says, before a British tabloid published their exact location and hordes of photographers descended, prompting them to head to the California home where their location was again published and paparazzi appeared in droves again.

""The plaintiffs have done everything in their power to stay out of the limelight, except in connection with their work, which they freely admit is newsworthy,"" according to the lawsuit, which says they ""simply want to continue the public impact work that is so important to them while having the private life to which any family or individual has the right.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/meghan-markle-prince-harry-son-photo-lawsuit-1.5661359?cmp=rss,news,world,

Rather than try to move or reschedule any of those events, the ATP and WTA tours announced they were scrapping all of them after China's General Administration of Sport said that country would not host any international sporting events the rest of this year because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Sources also accused Payette's secretary and longtime friend, Assunta Di Lorenzo, of harassing employees — calling some ""lazy"" and ""incompetent.""

""Harassment has no place in any professional workplace,"" PCO spokesperson Stéphane Shank said in the statement. ""It is a public service priority to advance efforts to more effectively prevent and resolve issues of harassment.""

The PCO statement said the Governor General's office is part of the core public service and is subject to Treasury Board policies, which include a policy against harassment.

Payette said in a statement she welcomes an independent review.

""I am deeply concerned with the media reports regarding the Office of the Governor General and I am completely committed to ensuring that every employee who works at Rideau Hall enjoys a secure and healthy work environment at all times and under all circumstances,"" Payette said. ""I take harassment and workplace issues very seriously.""

Earlier Thursday, the head of a union representing civil service workers called for an independent examination of the employees' claims.

The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) represents approximately 80 employees at Rideau Hall, including kitchen workers, cleaners, and maintenance and communications staff.

""Any claims of verbal abuse or harassment in the workplace are a top priority for the union to address,"" said PSAC national president Chris Aylward.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pco-independent-review-governor-general-1.5661236?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25402,2020-07-23 20:22,B.C. doctor heads to court to demand mandatory mask rules,"A family doctor in Burnaby, B.C., is asking for a court injunction requiring the province to bring in a mandatory mask policy for indoor spaces like restaurants, schools and public transit.

Dr. Wei Li filed a notice of application in B.C. Supreme Court Thursday morning, calling for Health Minister Adrian Dix to stop allowing Phase 3 of the pandemic response to continue without requiring masks in indoor public environments.

""Reopening communities while failing to require citizens to wear masks in public during a global pandemic is akin to allowing everyone to drive in a windowless car at 300 km/h in a hurricane without the need to wear a seatbelt,"" the notice of application says.

It states that Li ""is persistently worried and anxious that her community, her loved ones and herself may contract COVID-19.""

The application suggests masks should be required in ""restaurants, bars, hospitals, public transit, retail stores, educational institutions and theatres, provided that there are appropriate exemptions available for infants and those who are unable to wear a mask.""

Concerns about asymptomatic spread

During Phase 3 , many services including movie theatres and churches have been allowed to reopen at reduced capacity, and the government is once again encouraging residents to travel within the province.

Right now, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry generally recommends wearing a mask in situations like riding the bus, where physical distancing isn't possible.

She has so far resisted calls to make masks mandatory in indoor spaces, saying it's too difficult to enforce — especially when some people have legitimate reasons for not wearing a mask that may not be readily apparent to others.

In Thursday's daily COVID-19 briefing, Henry addressed Li's application, describing mandatory mask policies as a ""heavy handed"" approach to public health that she is not considering at this point. She said wearing a mask is a sign of courtesy and respect, but it remains the least effective method of preventing transmission of the virus, behind measures like physical distancing, limits on crowd size and good hygiene.

Dix declined to address the legal action while it is before the courts, but said he wears a mask in stores and on transit.

Li's application lays out the steady increase in new confirmed cases reported daily in recent weeks, and notes that B.C. has one of the lowest testing rates in the country.

""The prevalence of asymptomatic spread makes universal masking an essential means to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" the application reads.

It says the health minister is endangering public health by ""failing to provide strong, clear and consistent recommendations"" on the ""urgent need"" for widespread use of masks in public, indoor areas where risk of transmission is high.

Li also questions the strategy of emphasizing physical distancing over wearing masks, suggesting it isn't always possible to predict when someone might break the recommended two-metre barrier.

""When an individual realizes that someone has come too close to them, it may be too late to put on a mask and the transmission may have already occurred,"" the application says.

Epidemiologist says masks are 'common sense'

David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto, said he doesn't know enough about B.C.'s internal politics to say whether legal action is the best way to proceed.

But he described widespread mask use as ""one of the easy wins"" for getting the COVID-19 epidemic back under control.

""One of the frustrations with this disease is that we think about 50 per cent of all transmission of COVID happens in people before they have symptoms, and that's a very difficult problem to deal with,"" Fisman told CBC.

Everything from breathing to talking to singing and coughing produces droplets that could carry the novel coronavirus, and wearing masks can cut down significantly on droplets that reach other people.

As Henry revealed earlier this week, B.C.'s COVID-19 reproductive number has now jumped above one — which means each person who has the disease is now infecting more than one other person. That means conditions are being created where the curve of infection is no longer flat.

""Masks should be a way to take that reproduction number down a few notches,"" Fisman said. ""It's a common sense way to maintain economic activity while also doing easy stuff to prevent the virus from transmitting.""

25487,2020-07-23 20:20,Sexualized violence most common injury among Métis females in care: B.C.,"The findings of an investigation into critical injuries and deaths among Métis youth are troubling, British Columbia's children's advocate says.



Jennifer Charlesworth's report released Thursday analyzes data from 2015 to 2017 and shows sexualized violence is the most common type of injury among female children and youth.



All of the injuries reported occurred when the children were in care, the report said. Most of the children who were assaulted were between 14 and 18 years old.



The children and youth who experienced critical injuries were rarely placed with Métis families and were not connected with their culture, the report said.



Caregivers and families help foster connectedness for Métis children and youth in care and these ""valuable'' connections help them engage with their culture and learn about their cultural identities, it said.

""Historically, Métis children, youth and families, and their experiences, have been 'rolled up' in Indigenous data,'' the report said, adding this causes the children's issues to go unaddressed, and noting that Métis children and youth are over-represented in care.



The report examined 183 injuries that were reported for 117 Métis​​​​​​​ children and youth over the three years, with 95 of the injuries occurring while they were in government care.

Mental health concerns, suicide attempts

Suicide attempts were the second-most reported injury followed by caregiver mistreatment, the report said.

""Four of the 17 deaths of Métis​​​​​​​ children and youth that were part of this review were completed suicides,'' it said.



Mental health concerns and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or learning disabilities, were evident for those in care who experienced critical injuries, it said. The children also showed symptoms of anxiety disorder and depression, with these being more prevalent in girls, it added.



Métis​​​​​​​ are constitutionally recognized as Aboriginal people distinct from First Nations and Inuit, the report said.

""The Métis​​​​​​​ are descendants of early relationships between First Nations women and European fur traders.''



The goal of this project, it said, was to use the data to better understand outcomes and common challenges for Métis​​​​​​​ children and youth who are in care, highlight areas for improvement, and create a baseline of information.





The Ministry of Children and Family Development said in a statement Thursday the report will be ""very useful'' as it improves the child welfare system and works with Métis​​​​​​​ communities, partners and the federal government.



The government recognizes the need for Métis​​​​​​​ children and youth to be connected to their culture, the ministry said.

""Just as crucially, together with our partners we've been shifting child welfare practice to keep more children and youth out of care and safely within their families and communities,'' the ministry said.

""There's more work to do but we're making good progress with, overall, the lowest number of Indigenous children and youth in care, including Métis​​​​​​​, in the last 20 years.''



Charlesworth said a second report for the same time period will be released in the coming months examining similar data relating to First Nations and non-Indigenous children and youth.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sexualized-violence-most-common-injury-among-m%C3%A9tis-females-in-care-b-c-1.5661254?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25419,2020-07-23 20:10,Dustin Johnson bows out of 3M Open following dismal 1st round,"The virus outbreak has squelched the upbeat and welcoming vibe that marked the debut of the 3M Open last year.

The fans might have been absent, but the soft greens were plenty friendly Thursday for Richy Werenski to take full advantage.

""I have a good feeling they'll get nice and firm as the week goes on, but you start it online, it will stay there. They're really good,"" said Werenski, who made a short birdie putt on the par-5 18th for an 8-under 63 and the first-round lead.

Dustin Johnson withdrew because of a back injury after a 78.

Werenski broke a tie with Michael Thompson with his ninth and last birdie on the warm, windy afternoon at the TPC Twin Cities. Defending champion Matthew Wolff, Tony Finau, Nick Watney, Ryan Moore, Xinjun Zhang and Max Homa were tied for third at 65. There's an 11-way tie behind them at 5 under.

""To play a round like I did today, you've got to make the putts, but ... I feel like my irons have really been coming along,"" said the 24-year-old Werenski, who is winless on the PGA Tour and ranked 248th in the world.

Werenski has had two unexpected layoffs after finishing 126th in the FedEx Cup standings last year. He broke his wrist in the fall. Then came the pandemic that shut down the tour this spring.

""The goal at the beginning of the year was getting in the top 70, and I think I'm just a little bit more free than I kind of have been the beginning of the year,"" Werenski said. ""That makes a difference.""

Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., David Hearn of Brantford, Ont., and Calgary's Aaron Crawford — who earned his way into the 3M Open as a Monday qualifier — opened with 69s to come in at 2 under.

Michael Gligic, from Burlington, Ont., is well back after shooting a 1-over 72.

Thompson, who entered the week in 151st place in the FedEx Cup standings, enjoyed a bogey-free round, also thanks to the accuracy of his short game.

""It's really just being diligent about playing my own game. I'm not the longest hitter out here. I'm a really good putter, so I'm going to rely on that,"" Thompson said.

Lacking star power

Johnson's departure further depleted the star power of the second edition of the event that landed right after the Memorial and right before the World Golf Championship and the PGA Championship following the pandemic-forced reshuffling of the schedule. Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Tommy Fleetwood and Finau were the only entrants in the top 25 of the world ranking. This tournament, like all the others since golf's restart, is being played without spectators.

Johnson's victory at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut, last month did not spark a post-shutdown surge for the fourth-ranked player in the world. After posting back-to-back 80s last week at the Memorial for the highest 36-hole score of his pro career, Johnson's first appearance at the 3M Open north of Minneapolis lasted just one round.

At the end of his first nine, Johnson started the 599-yard, dog-leg 18th hole with a solid drive off the tee. With 209 yards to get to the flag, he used his 6-iron for a shot — ""perfect,"" he said — that was swallowed up in the pond just short of the rough.

""Hit it right at it and never once did I think it was going to go in the water,"" said Johnson, who did mention his back during a brief post-round interview.

His next two tries met the same fate. Three penalty strokes later, Johnson finally landed his ball on the green for a tap-in putt and a quadruple-bogey nine on the scorecard.

""Kind of the same last week. I just struggled with my iron play, and that makes it difficult,"" he said.

Watney rebounding from virus

Watney, who was the first tour player to test positive for the coronavirus, at the RBC Heritage on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, failed to make the cut two weeks ago at the Workday Charity Open in Dublin, Ohio, after a two-round score of 150.

The 39-year-old Watney, who has five career PGA Tour victories, went back to the basics in practice last week — aim, balance, posture — while most of his peers played the Memorial. Having emerged from the anxiety and tedium of quarantine, grateful his symptoms were mild, Watney was eager to make his six birdies the focus of his post-round interview with reporters.

""I'm trying to put that to bed, get past it and hopefully play some nice golf after coming down with that,"" Watney said. ""It's great to be up here after playing a good round as opposed to just other things.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/3m-open-thursday-recap-1.5661153?cmp=rss,sports,golf,

25416,2020-07-23 19:06,"U.S., U.K. accuse Russia of testing anti-satellite weapon in space","The U.S. accused Russia on Thursday of conducting a test of an anti-satellite weapon in space, asserting that it exposed Moscow's intent to deploy weapons that threaten U.S. and allied satellites.

In Moscow, the Defence Ministry said the July 15 event involved ""a small space vehicle"" that ""inspected one of the national satellites from a close distance using special equipment."" It added that the inspection ""provided valuable information about the object that was inspected, which was transmitted to the ground-based control facilities.""

The U.S., however, said the Russian actions were inconsistent with the stated mission of an inspector satellite.

""The Russian satellite system used to conduct this on-orbit weapons test is the same satellite system that we raised concerns about earlier this year, when Russia manoeuvred near a U.S. government satellite,"" said Gen. John W. Raymond, commander of Space Command and the head of U.S. Space Force.

""This is further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk.""

In a space strategy document published last month, the Pentagon asserted that ""China and Russia present the greatest strategic threat due to their development, testing, and deployment of counterspace capabilities and their associated military doctrine for employment in conflict extending to space.""

It added, ""China and Russia each have weaponized space as a means to reduce U.S. and allied military effectiveness and challenge our freedom of operation in space.""

'Event very suspicious'

Private U.S. space analysts said U.S. concerns about the July 15 event appear justified in an era of rapidly improving space technologies that could pose threats to satellites that are integral to modern life in the U.S. and globally. Defence of these satellites was a key reason the Trump administration create U.S. Space Force last December.

In a separate statement, the head of the British government's space directorate, Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, echoed the U.S. assertion about the July 15 event. He wrote on Twitter that the Russians had launched a projectile ""with the characteristics of a weapon.""

""We call on Russia to avoid any further such testing,"" Smyth wrote. ""We also urge Russia to continue to work constructively with the U.K. and other partners to encourage responsible behaviour in space.""

The U.S. State Department's top arms control official, Christopher Ford, said the event exposed Russia's ""hypocritical advocacy"" of outer space arms control, ""with which Moscow aims to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting its own counterspace program — both ground-based anti-satellite capabilities and what would appear to be actual in-orbit anti-satellite weaponry.""

Space Command said that on July 15 a Russian satellite, designated Cosmos 2543, ""operated in abnormally close proximity to a U.S. government satellite in low-earth orbit before it manoeuvred away and over to another Russian satellite, where it released another object in proximity to the Russia target satellite. This test is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the satellite as an inspector system, as described by Russia.""

Brian Weeden, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation, which advocates for peaceful uses of outer space, said in an interview that the U.S. and British concerns are justified.

""I think they're on to something,"" he said. ""I, too, found this event very suspicious.""

Weeden said an object separated from Cosmos 2543 at a speed of perhaps more than 400 miles per hour.

""That is unusual — very unusual,"" Weeden said. ""And it is very similar to an incident back in 2017 where another Russian satellite deployed a small object at high speed as well.""

Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the July 15 incident points up the fact that rapid advances in space technology require vigilance by U.S. defence agencies, particularly in light of worsening U.S. relations with Russia and China.

""So should be we concerned? I think that's legitimate,"" he said.

25415,2020-07-23 19:03,"Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Canada cites Huawei ban, increased NATO spending as top priorities","The woman nominated to serve as the new U.S. ambassador to Canada says she plans to apply fresh pressure on Ottawa to ban Huawei from taking part in Canada's 5G network.

During an appearance before the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee in Washington, Aldona Wos said that, if confirmed, she will ""... build on our existing bilateral cooperation to counter China's malign activities, and continue to raise concerns regarding the authorization of access to the 5G network by Huawei and other untrusted vendors.""

Canada is the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance — which includes the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand — that has not banned or restricted the Chinese tech giant from helping to build the country's 5G network.

Ottawa is carrying out a comprehensive review of Huawei's potential role in 5G that includes a broader, strategic look at how the technology can foster economic growth.

U.S. wants Canada to ban Huawei

Washington has threatened repeatedly to reconsider its intelligence-sharing arrangement with Ottawa if the company is allowed to participate in developing the sensitive technology, which will give internet users a speedier connection and provide vast data capacity.

The U.S. argues the company can be compelled to act as a spy agency for the Chinese government, and that it poses a significant national security risk.

Wos also offered broad support for Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the two Canadians being detained in China. Both men were taken into custody by Chinese authorities in December of 2018, shortly after Canada arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. extradition request.

""I will make clear the United States government's deep concern over China's retaliatory and arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens,"" she said.

In her opening remarks, Wos highlighted the integration of the Canada-U.S. relationship in the areas of defence and national security and vowed to deepen those ties.

""The United States-Canada relationship is one of enduring strength. It is built on broad and deep ties between our peoples, shared values, extensive trade, strategic global cooperation and defence partnerships,"" she said, reading from prepared notes.

Defence spending a thorny issue

Wos also vowed to apply more pressure on Canada to increase its defence spending — an issue raised by both the previous Obama administration and the current Trump administration.

""If confirmed, I will encourage Canada to provide critical capabilities to the alliance by meeting the commitments that all NATO leaders agreed to in the 2014 Wales pledge,"" she said.

The Wales pledge calls on all NATO members that are not currently spending the equivalent of 2 per cent of their country's gross domestic product (GDP) on defence to gradually increase spending and move toward that goal within a decade.

Canada's defence spending in 2019 was equal to 1.27 per cent of its GDP, according to NATO figures. There is no plan currently to meet the 2 per cent goal.

Canada's current defence policy calls for a 73 per cent budget increase by 2026-27, which would bring defence spending to 1.4 per cent of GDP.

If confirmed, Wos will replace Kelly Craft, President Donald Trump's first ambassador to Canada who oversaw the re-negotiation of NAFTA.

Craft's service impressed many in the White House and she left her post in Ottawa to become the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Wos faced fewer questions than other nominees at today's hearing. Much of the focus was on an appearance by Lisa Kenna, a long-time State Department employee nominated to serve as ambassador to Peru.

Kenna worked in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's office at the time of the Ukraine pressure campaign that led to President Trump's impeachment.

Wos asked about Canada-U.S. border closure

Wos was asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire about COVID-related restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border.

Shaheen said companies, hospitals and other medical providers in the northern part of her state have been negatively affected by the closure.

""Because of the nature of the pandemic that we all face, it is currently by mutual decision beneficial to both our countries to continue to have restrictions at our border,"" Wos replied.

""But those restrictions are mostly for tourist and recreational activities of travel through the border. It is critical for both our countries to continue to have our goods and services be able to flow freely through the borders.""

Shaheen said she hopes Wos can work to ensure that the border closure doesn't continue to disrupt trade between border states and Canada.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/us-ambassador-canada-confirmation-hearing-1.5660969?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25411,2020-07-23 18:29,Pompeo calls for 'new alliance of democracies' to oppose China,"The Trump administration took a hammer to one of the most significant Republican foreign policy achievements in the past five decades on Thursday, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declaring U.S. engagement with China a dismal failure.

As the administration sharpens its already harsh criticism of China with distinctly political overtones ahead of November's election, Pompeo traveled to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Thursday to pointedly lament that the former president's good and noble intentions in opening China to the world had come to naught and must be abandoned.

Nearly 50 years after Nixon's historic 1972 trip to China, Pompeo used the symbolism of the venue to accuse the Chinese of taking advantage of that opportunity to lie, cheat and steal their way to power and prosperity. Pompeo called for the free world to ""induce"" change in China, making an overt appeal for a new coalition of democratic nations to force the Chinese Communist Party change direction or face isolation. Pompeo said western engagement with China could not continue as it has.

""The free world must triumph over this new tyranny,"" he said in speech to an invited audience that included exiled Chinese dissidents. ""The old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it. We must not return to it.""

Tough rhetoric on China

Pompeo's speech was just the latest in series of Trump administration broadsides against China that have become an almost daily occurrence with cabinet-level officials from Pompeo, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Attorney General Bill Barr launching harsh criticisms of Beijing. The three men have each delivered public addresses attacking China in recent weeks, as has FBI director Christopher Wray.

WATCH | Trump signals bashing China will be part of re-election campaign:

Tensions with China seem likely to escalate in this U.S. election year, as President Donald Trump drops hints that bashing Beijing will be a central campaign theme. 4:50

Trump, who in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, was playing up his ""friendship"" and positive relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping in an apparent effort to preserve trade negotiations with the Chinese, now seems to have signed off on an all-out assault on China. This has come as his polling numbers decline over COVID-19 and he looks to paint his presumed challenger in November's election, former vice-president Joe Biden, as soft on China.

In his speech Pompeo called on nations to induce change in the Chinese Communist Party's behaviour ""because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity.""

China has roundly rejected the administration's accusations and taken particular aim at Pompeo, who it has accused of fomenting anti-Chinese sentiment around the world. China maintains that it is only seeking to develop its economy and society for the benefit of its own people and the world.

Calls for change in direction

Pompeo heaped scorn on China's position, calling it a clear threat to the world. ""If the free world doesn't change Communist China, Communist China will surely change us. There can be no return to past practices because they're comfortable, or because they're convenient.""

""The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,"" Pompeo said. ""The truth is that our policies — and those of other free nations — resurrected China's failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that fed it.""

Pompeo suggested the creation of a bloc, what he termed ""a new grouping of like-minded nations — a new alliance of democracies,"" to oppose China, although he was not specific about which countries should join. He did not mention the ""Community of Democracies"" group that was co-founded by the U.S. and Poland during former president Bill Clinton's administration to promote global human rights and rule of law globally, which has been ignored since Trump became president.

China, meanwhile, has embarked on its own effort to build alliances with infrastructure and financial assistance packages to developing nations. It has established a bloc of nations that vote with it at various United Nations and other international institutions, some of which the Trump administration has withdrawn from.

The State Department has been curtailing visas for Chinese and Communist Party officials involved in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and limiting the number of Chinese students and journalists allowed to come to the United States. In addition, the Commerce and Treasury departments have both announced new sanctions against China. They have warned private U.S. and foreign firms of potential penalties and reputational risk if they start or continue business with Chinese entities implicated by the U.S. in human rights abuses or clamping down on freedoms in Hong Kong.

On Wednesday, the administration ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, citing intellectual property theft, inappropriate actions on behalf of Chinese students and researchers and behaviour inconsistent with legitimate diplomats by consular officials based in the Texas city.

April 16: Employment and Social Development Canada officials mention WE in the context of the student program in an email discussion with Finance Department officials.

April 18: Morneau's officials raise the idea of partnering with a non-profit or for-profit group to administer the program. (ESDC officials suggest the same day that WE might be an option.) Morneau said it was the first time he was involved in any talk about WE and the grant program.

April 19: A senior official at Employment and Social Development Canada, Rachel Wernick, contacts WE co-founder Craig Kielburger. She learns of the April 9 proposal.

April 20: Morneau's office contacts WE to ask about its ability to deliver a volunteer program. An official's record of the call notes ""WE Charity will re-work their 10-week summer program proposal to fully meet the policy objective of national service and increase their current placements of 8,000 to double.""

April 21: Morneau approves going with an outside organization to run the volunteer program, but no specific group is chosen.

April 22: Trudeau announces a $9-billion package of student aid which includes the outline of a volunteer program paying students up to $5,000 toward education costs, based on the number of hours they volunteer. WE sends Wernick an updated proposal to reflect the announcement.

April 26: Morneau speaks with WE co-founder Craig Kielburger — but later told the finance committee neither of them talked about the Canada Student Service Grant program.

April 27: Volunteer Canada, a charity that promotes volunteering and helps organizations use volunteers, meets Chagger and raises concerns about paying students hourly rates below minimum wage and calling it volunteering.

May 4: WE sends a third proposal to Employment and Social Development Canada, this time with more details specific to the grant program. Finance Department official Michelle Kovacevic, who was working on the program, told the finance committee she received it May 7.

May 5: Chagger goes to a special COVID-19 cabinet committee with the recommendation to go with WE for the program. Morneau isn't at the meeting.

May 22: Cabinet, including Trudeau and Morneau, approves handing the reins of the program to WE.

May 23: The public service officially begins negotiating a contribution agreement with WE, which would have paid up to $43.5 million in fees to the group.

May 25 to June 3: In a series of meetings with Volunteer Canada, WE suggests the target for placements through the program had gone from 20,000 to 100,000.

June 12: WE co-founder Marc Kielburger says in a video chat with youth leaders that he heard from Trudeau's office about getting involved in the volunteer program the day after it was announced by the prime minister. He later backtracks, saying the contact came the week of April 26 from Wernick, and not the PMO.

June 23: WE is informed the contribution agreement has been approved.

June 25: Trudeau unveils more details about student aid. A government release notes that WE will administer the student-volunteer program.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to reporters outside Rideau Cottage on Monday. 2:51

June 26: Facing questions about WE, Trudeau says the non-partisan public service made the recommendation and the government accepted it: ""As the public service dug into it, they came back with only one organization that was capable of networking and organizing and delivering this program on the scale that we needed it, and that was the WE program.""

July 3: Citing the ongoing controversy, WE and the Liberals announce a parting of ways and the federal government takes control of the program. Ethics commissioner Mario Dion tells Conservative and NDP ethics critics in separate letters he will examine Trudeau's role in the awarding of the agreement because of the prime minister's close ties to the group.

July 9: WE says it has paid Trudeau's mother Margaret about $250,000 for 28 speaking appearances at WE-related events between 2016 and 2020. His brother Alexandre was paid $32,000 for eight events, and Trudeau's wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received $1,400 in 2012 for a single appearance. The organization says Trudeau himself has never been paid by the charity or its for-profit arm.

July 13: Trudeau apologizes for not recusing himself from discussions about WE due to his family's longtime involvement with the organization. Morneau also issues an apology.

July 16: Dion says he will investigate Morneau's actions in the affair. Chagger testifies at the finance committee, saying Trudeau's office didn't direct her to go with WE.

July 21: Ian Shugart, clerk of the Privy Council, tells the Commons finance committee there is no evidence to suggest Trudeau spoke with WE before the organization was awarded the deal to run the student-volunteer program.

Clerk of the Privy Council Ian Shugart told MPs on the finance committee that the prime minister and finance minister had to be involved in discussions over whether WE Charity should administer the program because of its size and importance. But he stressed that he was not making a judgment on whether they should have recused themselves from the final decision. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)

July 22: Morneau tells the finance committee he just repaid over $41,000 to WE for travel expenses the organization covered for the minister and his family. The Opposition Conservatives call for Morneau to resign.

Trudeau's office says he and his chief of staff, Katie Telford, have agreed to testify before the committee with a date and time to be set.

The House of Commons ethics committee also calls on Trudeau to testify, and votes to seek copies of records for Trudeau and his family's speaking appearances dating back years. Six opposition members outvote five Liberals to have that committee start its own investigation.

25565,2020-07-23 18:04,New online 'handbook' puts Yukon Indigenous history at your fingertips,"When Yukon University instructor Victoria Castillo and some colleagues decided they needed a new resource book for teaching Indigenous history in the territory, they thought it would be a pretty straightforward job.

They had already collected a lot of material and readings to use in some of their classes, and they wanted to pull it all together into an up-to-date ""handbook.""

""We thought it was going to take maybe six months to a year,"" Castillo said. ""It actually took us seven years to complete the book, as a group,"" she said.

The book is called ECHO: Ethnographic, Cultural and Historical Overview of Yukon's First Peoples, and it's now available online to download for free.

It covers a lot of ground — from looking at the landscape and geology of Yukon, to Indigenous origin stories, to land claims and modern-day governance, art and culture.

""It's a big overview,"" Castillo says.

Yukon University instructors Victoria Castillo and Tosh Southwick, along with Christine Schreyer of the University of B.C., spent seven years putting the book together. (Yukon University)

Castillo and co-author Tosh Southwick have been teaching courses on Yukon Indigenous history and culture for years at what's now Yukon University. A lot of the resource material they'd been using was decades-old, Castillo said, and sometimes the language was ""dated.""

""So we wanted to put together something that kind of updated all of these amazing resources that already exist,"" Castillo said.

Southwick said the intention in creating the book was to include both Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives. It was tough sometimes for the co-authors to agree on what to include, she said.

""We often hear about and read about ourselves in the North from people who live and work in the South. An interesting part for me was making sure there were northern perspectives in it,"" Southwick said.

""It was a great process. We didn't always agree on what we were going to include, but we always got to a good spot and a good end.""

Castillo said one of the most interesting parts for her was interviewing people about some of the ongoing community-based research in Yukon — archeological, anthropological, historical — and including those interviews in the book.

""I think that those really stand out, because you see the relationships that have been built when proper research is done, when community-based research is happening and when people are feeling good about the work that's being done in the territory,"" she said.

Victoria Castillo (<a href=""https://twitter.com/Runner_Victory?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Runner_Victory</a>) and Tosh Southwick share some thoughts on their new book, ECHO: Ethnological, Cultural and Historical overview of Yukon’s First Nations Peoples. What was their intent? <a href=""https://t.co/U4rCx4riL3"">pic.twitter.com/U4rCx4riL3</a> —@YukonUniversity

The authors say that because the book exists as an online document, it can be updated and revised often to incorporate new research and new perspectives.

Southwick says the response to the book has already been great.

""I think the best response is from some youth who have reached out and said, 'thank you, thank you for producing something here about us that is real and is authentic,'"" she said.

""It's gone way further than I think we intended.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-first-nations-history-book-1.5659071?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
25408,2020-07-23 17:39,"Blue Jays in talks with Orioles, Maryland state officials to play in Baltimore","The Baltimore Orioles and the state of Maryland have had talk about the team sharing Oriole Park at Camden Yards with the displaced Toronto Blue Jays amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Blue Jays are looking for a Major League park after the Canadian government declined to allow them to play in Toronto, and the state of Pennsylvania nixed a deal to play in Pittsburgh because of frequent travel throughout the United States.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan acknowledged in an interview with The Associated Press there have been talks about the state hosting the Blue Jays.

""We've had some discussions with the Orioles. I don't know the final details of that. Obviously, we're watching our numbers very carefully everyday. We're concerned about the spikes in other states. I know major baseball is also taking a look at it day to day,"" Hogan told The AP.

""We're not ready to put fans in the stands, but if you have, you know, a couple of guys standing in the field with masks on pretty far distanced from each other, and they can figure out a way to do it safely, maybe it can happen.""

WATCH | Blue Jays' Toronto plan denied by federal government:

CBC News' David Cochrane discusses the reasons why the federal government rejected the Toronto Blue Jays' request to play regular season baseball games in Toronto. 7:04

Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said discussions are still happening ""but we don't have any announcement to make right now just yet.""

""Maryland Stadium Authority is talking to the Orioles about it, so that's where the discussions currently are on the state level, and then I think once they've kind of come to an agreement on something they'll bring it to the governor and the health department,"" Ricci told the AP.

A source familiar with the matter told the AP the Orioles are engaged in talks with the Blue Jays about playing ""home games"" at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The official said the Orioles are trying to help Toronto however they can but says there are lots of logistics to be worked through yet in terms of feasibility. The official said the Blue Jays would build a makeshift clubhouse in the stadium concourse in one scenario.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the Blue Jays are working on other contingencies, too.

The Blue Jays may find it hard to get clearance to play in Baltimore as COVID-19 cases doubled in the city in the past month. Masks will be mandatory in indoor public spaces starting Friday and Mayor Bernard Young announced a halt to indoor dining, about a month after allowing restaurants to half full.

Buffalo looms as fallback plan

Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's secretary of health, noted a significant increase in the number of cases in southwestern Pennsylvania and the risk of adding travellers to the region as the reason to decline the Blue Jays' request to play in Pittsburgh. The Blue Jays and the Pirates had an agreement to for the team to play at PNC Park pending state approval.

But the number of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus reported daily by Allegheny County — which includes Pittsburgh and 1.2 million residents — has increased tenfold in the last two weeks and the state rejected the plan.

Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins said this week his team had more than five contingency plans for a home stadium and was in talks with other teams. Blue Jays outfielder Randal Grichuk said Tuesday the players were told Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore is a possibility.

Atkins said if the Blue Jays can't find a major league park, their Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo, New York, would be their most likely site for home games. But based on what the players want and the collaboration they are getting from other teams and MLB, Atkins said the Blue Jays are focused on major league parks, as long as they can be safe. He said health and safety is the priority, so the ability to be socially distant without comprising other teams' ability to maintain social distance is important.

The team had been considering playing home games at its training facility in Dunedin, Florida, but that is among the states that are virus hot spots.

If a major league stadium can't be found, the Blue Jays could be facing a 60-game road trip, playing opposing teams in their own ballparks instead of a home park.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/blue-jays-regular-season-home-baltimore-1.5660277?cmp=rss,sports,baseball,mlb
25409,2020-07-23 17:00,"MLB, players agree to expanded 16-team playoff format for 2020 season: reports","Major League Baseball and the players' union agreed Thursday to expand the playoffs from 10 teams to 16 for the pandemic-delayed season, a person familiar with the deal said, a decision that makes it likely teams with losing records will reach the post-season.

The agreement was reached hours before the season opener between the New York Yankees and World Series champion Washington Nationals, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement was subject to owner approval.

Sixteen of the 30 teams will advance to a best-of-three first round. Those winners move on to the best-of-five Division Series, where the usual format resumes. The final four teams are in best-of-seven League Championship Series, and the pennant winners meet in the best-of-seven World Series.

As part of the deal, MLB agreed to guarantee a post-season pool that would be $50 million if the entire post-season is played. The post-season pool usually comprises ticket money from the post-season, but baseball anticipates playing the entire year in empty ballparks due to the coronavirus.

""It's such a unique season, why not try a little something different and make it as exciting as possible,"" said Colorado shortstop Trevor Story, whose team has never won a World Series title. ""I know it's going to be such a sprint with the 60-game season; adding more playoff teams will just add to the fire and the excitement and the fandom around the game. Anything can happen in a 60-game season. I'm all for it.""

WATCH | Astros prepare for season amid scrutiny over cheating scandal:

As it prepares to resume during the pandemic, Major League Baseball is also wrestling with the legacy of a cheating scandal involving World Series champions, the Houston Astros. 8:21

The change means 53 per cent of the 30 teams reach the playoffs. If eight teams qualified for the playoffs in each league from 1995 through 2019, 46 teams at or below .500 would have made it, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, an average of just under two per season. Those teams included 25 from the AL.

There would have been only three seasons in which all playoff teams would have had winning records, Elias said: 2000, 2003 and 2009.

""From a selfish, White Sox standpoint, I'm certainly in favour of it just for the mere fact that it enhances the possibilities that this group's going to get exposed to October baseball,"" Chicago White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said. ""We've talked over the years of this rebuild and into this next stage that learning how to win is part of that. And certainly learning how to win in October is very much part of getting us to our ultimate goals.""

MLB long restricted its post-season to just the pennant winners facing each other in the World Series. Postseason teams doubled to four with the split of each league into two divisions in 1969, then to eight with the realignment to three divisions and the addition of a wild card in 1995, a year later than planned due to a players' strike. The post-season reached 10 with the addition of a second wild card and a wild-card round in 2012.

The new format created a minimum 14 additional post-season games and as many as 22 if each first-round series goes the distance. The plan was part of MLB's proposal last month to restart the season, but the union ended those talks and told MLB to unilaterally announce a schedule. That move preserved the union's right to file a grievance claiming MLB did not negotiate in good faith to play as long a regular season as economically feasible, subject to conditions set in a March 26 agreement between the feuding sides.

""It would be a great way to keep fan bases engaged throughout the entire season,"" Milwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich said. ""You'd have a really tight race all the way down to the last day of the season. I think there'd be a lot of teams in it within a game or two of each other going into that final day.""

Two additional NFL teams reach the playoffs this season for a total of 14 of 32 NFL teams. Sixteen of 30 usually go to the playoffs in the NBA and 16 of 31 in the NHL (52 per cent), which expands to 32 franchises next season.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/mlb-expanded-playoff-format-1.5660923?cmp=rss,sports,baseball,mlb
25397,2020-07-23 16:38,Greece firefighters gain ground in wildfire battle,"A drop in high winds late Thursday helped firefighters gain ground on a large wildfire in southern Greece that raged for more than a day, forcing the evacuations of villages and summer camps.

Fire chief Stefanos Kolokouris said the blaze east of the town of Corinth was abating.

""There is no active front right now,"" he told state ERT TV.

Earlier, authorities evacuated one more village and a children's summer camp as a precaution, and 20 water-dropping planes and helicopters assisted more than 300 firefighters on the ground struggling to contain the blaze.

Evacuation orders were issued for seven villages and two camps since the wildfire started Wednesday at the seaside settlement of Kechries, more than 80 kilometres southwest of Athens, and rapidly spread inland.

The aircraft withdrew after nightfall since they can't fly in the dark.

Firefighters on foot strove to put out scattered small blazes before daybreak, when high winds forecast for Friday could once again whip them up into fast-moving fronts.

The fire burned farmland as well as pine and olive trees and gutted or seriously damaged around 10 homes, local officials said. One firefighter was slightly injured.

The Fire Service said a total 72 forest fires broke out all over Greece since Wednesday evening, with most quickly extinguished.

Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, arid summers. Two years ago, a fire ravaged the seaside resort of Mati, east of Athens, leaving 102 people dead.

25400,2020-07-23 16:18,The Olympics are 1 year away (again) (maybe),"This is an excerpt from The Buzzer, which is CBC Sports' daily email newsletter. Stay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here.

Here's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:

The Tokyo Olympics are exactly 1 year away (we hope)

The opening ceremony was originally scheduled for Friday, July 24, until the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers made the unprecedented decision to push it back a year due to the pandemic. So the Games are now slated to begin on Friday, July 23, 2021.



Will that actually happen? No one can say right now. Four months after the postponement was announced, COVID-19 continues to hold much of the world in varying states of semi-paralysis. The United States, which is the Olympics' top country in terms of both medals won and TV revenue generated, is struggling mightily to contain the disease (or, more to the point, not struggling hard enough). Tokyo is also experiencing a surge in infections, and the head of its Olympic organizing committee said this week that the Games could not be held under the current conditions. Another postponement probably isn't an option. IOC and Tokyo officials have indicated that if the Games can't be held next summer, they won't be held at all.



If that's the scenario that plays out, Canada could miss out on one of its most successful Olympics ever. The sports data company Gracenote projects the Canadian team will win 22 medals in Tokyo. That would match 1996 and 2016 for Canada's highest total at a non-boycotted Summer Olympics. And the model has Canada winning five gold medals — one more than in '16 and two more than in '96. One caveat is that there are more events in the Olympics now, and therefore more medals. So while 22 was the 10th-highest total at the 2016 Rio Games, it would only be good for 13th in Tokyo, per Gracenote's system.



Looking deeper into what we might be missing this summer (or to put it more optimistically, what we might see next summer), the model predicts Canada's gold medals will come from Damian Warner (decathlon), Kylie Masse (swimming — women's 100m backstroke), Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes (women's beach volleyball), Laurence Vincent-Lapointe (canoe — women's singles) and Vincent-Lapointe and Katie Vincent (canoe — women's doubles).



Notice that four of those five gold come from women. That disparity carries over into the overall medal total, where men account for only three of Canada's 22 podium finishes. Besides Warner's decathlon gold, the model has Andre De Grasse taking bronze in the 200 metres and Evan Dunfee scoring silver in the 50km race walk.



The bulk of the women's medals are in the water. The model has Canadian swimmers reaching seven podiums — including a gold for Kylie Masse in the 100m backstroke, silvers for Masse in the 200 back and Maggie MacNeil in the 100 butterfly, and bronze for Sydney Pickrem in the 200 individual medley. 2016 Olympic darling Penny Oleksiak will be shut out of the solo medals this time, according to Gracenote. But she's likely to have a hand in all three relay bronze Canada is projected to win. The system also has Canada winning four diving medals, with Meaghan Benfeito and Jennifer Abel landing a pair each.



Two more interesting things, both in gymnastics: the model says Rosie MacLennan will fall just short of a three-peat in the solo trampoline event, taking silver. And Ellie Black will become only the second Canadian — and first Canadian woman — to win a medal in traditional gymnastics, taking bronze in the marquee individual all-around event.

The NHL's Seattle expansion team named itself the Kraken

That's a mythical sea creature (""Release the Kraken!""). In keeping with the aquatic theme, the team's primary colours (also unveiled today) are dark blue and light blue, with some red trim mixed in. The main logo (somewhat surprisingly, given the wackiness of the name) is quite simple: a stylized ""S"" that invokes the creature rising out of the water. The secondary logo is an anchor fashioned to resemble Seattle's Space Needle. Here's what the home jersey looks like, courtesy of the Twitter account @icethetics:

The jersey really is a thing of beauty! I can’t wait to wear one. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEAKraken?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SEAKraken</a> <a href=""https://t.co/TiP9ex3TWe"">pic.twitter.com/TiP9ex3TWe</a> —@icethetics

Among the other names considered were Sockeyes, Evergreens and Metropolitans. The latter was the name of Seattle's team in the old Pacific Coast Hockey Association. They won the Stanley Cup in 1917, a few months before the NHL was founded.



The Seattle Kraken will become the NHL's 32nd team when they begin play for the 2021-22 season. They'll be placed in the Pacific Division, bumping the Arizona Coyotes to the Central so that each division will have eight teams. Seattle's owners paid a record $650-million US expansion fee, easily eclipsing the $500 million Vegas forked over only a few years ago. An $800-million rebuild of Seattle's old arena is also underway. Read more about the team's new name and logo here.

Quickly...

Washington's NFL team rebranded (sort of). Ten days ago, the team announced it was ""retiring"" the Redskins name and logo, but didn't say when. That day arrived today, when the franchise said it will now officially be known as the Washington Football Team. The plan is to go by that for the 2020 season, giving the team more time to come up with a permanent name. Washington will still use its traditional burgundy and gold colours for its uniforms. In place of the old logo on the helmets will be the player's jersey number. Read more about the changes in Washington here.



Against all odds, all three Canadian teams advanced at the MLS is Back Tournament. On Tuesday, Toronto won its group, but the others' chances didn't look so hot heading into their final match of the group stage. FiveThirtyEight's projection model gave Montreal a 30 per cent chance of landing a wild-card spot in the round of 16, and Vancouver only a 4 per cent chance. But Montreal won and got the help it required to advance. Vancouver got help too, and today it earned the multi-goal win it needed, beating Chicago 2-0 with goals in the 65th and 71st minutes. In the next round, the tournament becomes single-elimination. Montreal faces Orlando on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET, and Toronto faces a TBD team Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ET. Vancouver's opponent and match day/time will be known after the group stage wraps up tonight. Read more about the Whitecaps' big win here.



The National Women's Soccer League final is set. It's an unlikely matchup between the Houston Dash, who were seeded fourth for the knockout stage, and the sixth-seeded Chicago Red Stars. A new champion will be crowned because the North Carolina Courage, who won the title the last two years and had a perfect record heading into the quarter-finals, were upset by Portland. In yesterday's semis, Houston blanked Portland 1-0 and Chicago beat Sky Blue FC 3-2. Chicago's lone Canadian player, Bianca St. Georges, scored one of the goals. The Challenge Cup final kicks off Sunday at 12:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast by the American network CBS.



Mookie Betts got the second-biggest contract in baseball history. Boston traded the 2018 AL MVP, who's still very much in his prime, to the Dodgers over the winter because they were too cheap to give him a long-term contract. L.A. chose not to make the same mistake, locking Betts up to a 12-year, $365-million US extension. In terms of total money, only Mike Trout's $426.5M deal with the L.A. Angels is larger. Betts will be in action tonight as the shortened MLB season opens with two games: Yankees vs. Nationals at 7 p.m. ET and Giants vs. Dodgers at 10 p.m. ET.

25398,2020-07-23 16:17,"25 years after Beeper Spence was murdered, his mother says little has changed","Twenty-five years after her son was shot in Winnipeg's North End, Joseph ""Beeper"" Spence's mother says the community is no safer now than it was then.

""It's sad. It breaks my heart thinking that I lost my son … because of this stupid gang violence, and this stuff is still happening,"" said Nancy Flett.

On July 23, 1995, 13-year-old Beeper was shot and killed on Flora Avenue. His death shocked the city when it happened, because it was still uncommon to see such a young victim of a violent crime.

""A lot of things haven't changed from 25 years ago when Beeper was taken away,"" said Flett.

Beeper was the oldest of Flett's three children. She describes him as the protective big brother who was always looking out for his sisters, as well as a joker and an athlete who loved to be outdoors.

His sister, April Spence says her teenage son, Dominic, closely resembles him and loves to play baseball, just like Beeper. That resemblance has created a special bond between Dominic and his grandmother Nancy.

A family photo of Beeper in the middle with his sisters April (orange sweater) and Tracy (grey sweater) (Submitted)

""I just feel like that's his way of connecting to the kids, especially my oldest son,"" said April.

In the week leading up to the anniversary of his death, Flett said she's been fighting back tears and suffering from flashbacks of the night he was shot.

She still lives in the North End, just a few blocks away from where the shooting happened.

Fewer cultural institutions in the North End

About six years after his death, Flett and her daughters, April and Tracey, helped launch the Lighthouse program at the Indian and Métis Friendship Centre in Winnipeg. She says youth-specific programs like Lighthouse helped keep young people in the community out of trouble.

""It was created after Beeper passed away to give youth a safe haven — a safe place to be and to meet people,"" Flett said.

In 2011, the drop-in centre dedicated to her son closed because of a lack of funding. In the past few years, other cultural institutions like Neechi Foods and the Indian and Métis Friendship Centre closed as well, she said.

The friendship centre had management issues forcing it to close down. The closure left a void for Indigenous people living in the inner-city, Flett said.

""The friendship centre belonged to the community,"" said Flett. ""We need something that the community has ownership of, where it's a part of them.""

Helping the community

Community advocate Mitch Bourbonniere has dedicated his career to helping young Indigenous people at risk of gangs and crime. As someone who has been working in the North End for 35 years now, he remembers what it was like when the shooting happened.

""It was the biggest news ever in the North End at the time,"" said Bourbonniere. ""It was brewing for a long time and it scared a lot of people.""

Bourbonniere says it's stressful for people living in the North End when they have to deal with violent events, like a random attack with a hammer on a 15-year-old in June.

But he says a lot of changes have come from the residents who live there despite the violence.

""What I do think is better than 1995 is the grassroots activities that are now happening in the North End by the people, for the people,"" said Bourbonniere, pointing to things like the Bear Clan Patrol and Meet Me at The Bell Tower, a Stop the Violence movement.

""There's still the element of gangs and danger and stress and poverty, but there's also a lot of cool resources that we didn't have back then, and lots of them are led by the community and community members,"" he said​​​​​​.

When Flett thinks back to the '90s, she feels there was more programming available for families in the inner city. She also thinks that today, things like leisure and recreational activities are out of reach for low-income familes because they've become too expensive.

""There's nothing around here anymore,"" said Flett. ""Things are so costly for families, like back then a lot of times things used to be free for kids to join or maybe a low cost.""

She would like to see more support from government for inner-city youth.

""They can start by offering them jobs at a younger age,"" said Flett.

Flett said she has seen her neighborhood and the people who are living there change over the years and believes that it has caused friction in the community.

She would like to see a better understanding that people are often moved into the neighborhood without resources, and would like to see the newcomer and Indigenous community come together to learn more about each other.

A City of Winnipeg spokesperson said in an email the city offers support to programs like the Winnipeg Aboriginal Sport Achievement Centre and the Sports Program in Inner City Neighborhoods (SPIN).

City council has also adopted a newcomer welcome and inclusion policy and framework, and work will continue to develop a poverty reduction strategy, the spokesperson wrote.

25393,2020-07-23 15:57,"NBA earns high marks for diversity hiring practices, study says","A diversity report for racial and gender hiring in the NBA found more people of colour serving as general managers and more women filling team management roles.

Thursday's report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida assigned an overall A-minus score, with an A-plus for racial hiring and a B for gender hiring. The report examined a range of positions at the league headquarters and within franchises from the start of the 2019-20 season, then updated data this month as the league prepared to restart play amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Most notably, people of colour represented 28 per cent of general managers for a 24-year high at the start of the season, then reached 40 per cent with the July update. The study also found that women filled 33 per cent of team management positions, the highest mark in two decades after the overall gender score had fallen on each of the previous two report cards.

TIDES director Richard Lapchick, the lead report author, said the NBA ""has been and continues to be the highest scoring men's league when you're combining race and gender hiring practices.""

""They have the most proactive diversity-inclusion office in professional sport,"" Lapchick said in an interview. ""And of course, they're the same team that also leads the WNBA's efforts in that area. They really take things to heart. But they want to keep pushing themselves. It's one of the things I admire about the NBA's leadership.""

WATCH | Canadian sports still lacking diversity:

Canadian universities and national sports groups say they have to do more to diversify their coaching staff and leadership, after CBC Sports carried out a visual audit and found the vast majority of those positions are held by people who are white. 2:10

High coaching grades

The league received A-plus grades in racial hiring for its headquarters, players, head coaches, assistant coaches, team management and team professional staff, along with an A-minus for team general managers and B-plus for team vice-presidents.

For gender hiring, highlights included women holding 40.3 per cent of professional positions at the league headquarters and 39 per cent of those roles at the team level, both good for a B-plus. The study also reported an all-time high of women making up 26.6 per cent of vice-president or higher positions at the team level, though that was good only for a D-plus as an area for improvement.

Another positive cited was the league's push to hire women as assistant coaches. Nine served in that role for 2019-20, compared with three a year earlier. Two recently took over power-conference college programs: Memphis' Niele Ivey became head coach at alma mater Notre Dame in April and Boston's Kara Lawson became Duke's head coach on July 11.

Additionally, nine NBA teams had a person of colour or a woman as majority team owner, with no other men's league ""even close"" to that total, according to the study.

Lapchick attributed slight decreases in the NBA's overall and racial hiring scores due to TIDES changing its methodology to add a category for team chief executive officers or presidents in its report cards going forward. The league received F grades in that category for both racial and gender hiring, with people of colour and women each representing 10.9 per cent of those positions.

25406,2020-07-23 15:37,One family's experience with a medical scare when 911 lines went down,"When Beverly Bate dialled 911 on her landline, the Kingston Peninsula woman couldn't understand why she was unable to get through.

Her 12-year-old granddaughter needed to be rushed to hospital after a sudden emergency just before 9 a.m. on Wednesday.

""I kept hanging up because I thought I was doing something wrong,"" said Bate, a retired nurse, whose home is almost 40 kilometres north of Saint John on the St. John River.

At the time, Bate and her family didn't realize 911 lines were down across New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

When she tried to get through to a dispatcher, she would get a recorded voice message that said her call wasn't going through and to stay on the line.

Bate thought her phone wasn't working. But her daughter, the child's mother, called 911 several times on her cellphone and received the same recorded message.

""It was so weird that 911 wasn't responding,"" Bate said.

'It was terrifying'

Eventually, her daughter was able to reach a dispatcher she believes was somewhere in the United States because of her accent and because the dispatcher had no idea where they were in New Brunswick.

The dispatcher told her to stay on the line, but the family needed to get to a hospital.

So they left — forgetting to lock the door behind them and losing a cellphone in their haste.

""It was terrifying,"" Bate said.

According to Bell Aliant, a network switch failure in Moncton on Wednesday morning affected wireless and landline calls to varying degrees in the Atlantic provinces, including 911 service.

""The fact that the whole three provinces could go down and it was one switch in Moncton — that just seems crazy there's no backup,"" Bate said.

Including a ride on the Gondola Point Ferry, it took the famiy about 40 minutes to get to the Saint John Regional Hospital. On arrival, they found the hospital quiet, without any ambulance vehicles coming or going.

Bate said some doctors and staff weren't even aware the 911 service was down.

Province was considering alert

Starting around 9:15 a.m. Wednesday, police forces started tweeting alternative emergency numbers for people to call. At that time, the RCMP also said on Twitter that a public Alert Ready message had been requested, but nothing was sent out before the 911 service was fixed, which the RCMP tweeted at 10:42.

Geoffrey Downey, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, said the province was preparing for the provincial messaging when it learned that regular telecommunications services had been restored.

An alert would have gone to people's phones as a text message, informing them 911 lines were down.

""At the time that phone service was restored, we were considering issuing an alert as we determined the scope of the problem and solutions for members of the public impacted by the telecommunications issues,"" Downey said.

Bate doesn't have a cellphone. Her daughter does, but it's an Ontario number.

""Whether that text would've gone to her, given it's an Ontario number, I don't know,"" she said.

Paramedics arrive almost 3 hours later

When Bate and the family, including the granddaughter, returned from the hospital later that day, they spotted a ""sweet note"" left behind by paramedics in the entryway of her house.

The paramedics had arrived three hours after the 911 call.

Bate said she isn't sure when or how paramedics learned of the 911 call. In their note, they called it ""a hangup.""

""Of course, we did hang up because we couldn't talk to anybody,"" Bate said.

Since the door was unlocked paramedics went inside, where they were unable to find anyone in distress.

Their note also said they found a cellphone in the driveway and told the family to ""take care.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/911-phone-line-down-emergency-1.5660168?cmp=rss,news,canada,new-brunswick

The Special Investigations Unit says the Peel Regional Police officer declined to be interviewed and also chose not to submit a copy of his notes.

Under the Police Services Act, subject officers cannot be legally compelled to speak with the SIU, the agency said in a news release Thursday afternoon.

Choudry's family said he suffered from schizophrenia and various other medical conditions, and that they had called a non-emergency line with concerns that he wasn't taking his medication.

When paramedics arrived, nephew Hassan Choudhary previously told CBC News, they spotted his uncle's pocketknife — something he kept with him because he felt police ""were out to get him.""

Choudry told family members he wanted to kill himself, according to Choudhary. But no mobile crisis unit was deployed to Choudry's home.

Instead, police have said they used a Taser and plastic bullets on Choudry, and opened fire when those had no effect.

Choudry died at the scene.

In its news release Thursday, the SIU said, it's completed its fieldwork on the Choudry case but that the investigation remains open ""pending receipt of additional information including evidence from counsel for the man's family.""

The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) says the Peel Regional Police officer, whose name has not been released, declined to be interviewed and has also chosen not to submit a copy of his notes.

Under the Police Services Act, officers under investigation, referred to as ""subject officers,"" cannot be legally compelled to speak with the SIU, the agency said in a news release Thursday afternoon.

The Choudry family's lawyer said it's ""troubling but not surprising"" that the officer won't speak with the SIU.

""There is nothing he could possibly say that could excuse or justify shooting Ejaz,"" said Nader Hasan.

The officer's refusal marks the third case to come to light in recent weeks in which subject officers have chosen not to speak with the watchdog. CBC News revealed Wednesday that two officers from Peel Region involved in the fatal Tasering of Clive Mensah also refused.

Last month, the SIU also indicated the Peel police officer who fatally shot D'Andre Campbell had declined an interview.

All three cases involve Black people or people of colour whose families say they were struggling with mental health issues.

Debate about officers' rights

In SIU investigations, subject officers are treated essentially the same as suspects in a criminal investigation. As such, they share the same charter rights as any other member of the public, including the right not to incriminate themselves.

However, the recent cases have sparked debate about whether police officers should be compelled to speak with investigators.

Choudry's family said he suffered from schizophrenia and various other medical conditions, and that they had called a non-emergency line with concerns that he wasn't taking his medication.

25407,2020-07-23 15:32,"New backyard chicken fad has risks, warns veterinarian","An infectious disease veterinarian is warning that raising chickens and other kinds of poultry can be risky.

In step with a national trend, more Prince Edward Islanders are keeping backyard chickens this summer — part of a movement of people wanting to grow their own food.

""We know that poultry, especially young poultry, are a high-risk species for some things like salmonella,"" said Dr. Scott Weese, an infectious disease veterinarian and professor at the Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph, Ont. He's studying backyard chickens in that province, where there has been a similar peak in interest.

Weese is worried that people adopting backyard chickens may not know the risks they could be exposing themselves to — including a couple of bad intestinal infections.

Risk of illness

Chickens commonly carry bacteria such as salmonella and campylobacter, which can cause intestinal disease in humans. Those most at risk of contracting disease from chickens are children under five, the elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.

'Are people going to maintain proper winter coops, are they going to abandon them, are they going to surrender them to the Humane Society?' asks infectious disease veterinarian Dr. Scott Weese. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)

Humans are exposed to the bacteria through the chickens' feces — for example, when they handle the animals without thoroughly washing their hands immediately afterward, allow chickens inside the home, or come into contact with water runoff containing feces.

""I think they can be done safely with some common sense; the problem is, common sense isn't always that common,"" said Weese.

The risk can be reduced by washing your hands, supervising children near the birds, locating coops in a proper area, and not keeping chickens if you or someone in the immediate vicinity is immune-compromised, the veterinarian said.

Responsible chicken ownership

Weese said he is concerned not only for the health of people adopting the birds, but also for wellbeing of the chickens. They need enough space, proper food and water, and protection from predators. Owners must know how to identify illness in the birds and how to care for them.

I would not offer rentals if I didn't feel like the chickens would be well cared for. — Sally Bernard, owner of Barnyard Organics

""You can't just chuck them in the backyard and expect them to thrive,"" he said.

People also need to think about the chickens' future, he said, since people could become bored with the trend.

""Are people going to maintain proper winter coops, are they going to abandon them, are they going to surrender them to the Humane Society?"" he said, comparing it to people buying rabbits around Easter, then becoming disenchanted.

'Common-sense food handling'

Sally Bernard owns Barnyard Organics, a P.E.I. business that rents out egg-laying hens. She noted via email that she thoroughly educates her customers before they take possession of their chickens.

""I'm always careful to ensure that folks know that they need to wash their hands and use common-sense food handling,"" Bernard said, adding that she has never heard of an issue with any of the business's hens or eggs.

""As for the humane care of the hens, when we drop them off we can see where they're going to live [and] who will be caring for them, and give a thorough 'training,' both verbally and written, to ensure they understand the needs of their chickens,"" she said.

She also gives customers a book that includes in-depth care details for all seasons.

Bernard said that while customers vary in how much personal investment they have in their hens, she has never picked up a rental that caused concern.

""In fact most of the time, the renters send me home with a list of the hens' favourite snacks, toys, time of day they lay their egg, etc.,"" she said.

""I would not offer rentals if I didn't feel like the chickens would be well cared for.""

25410,2020-07-23 15:30,"Sharp rise in COVID-19 cases a 'wake-up call' for Alberta, province's top doctor says","The sharp rise in active COVID-19 cases over the past week should be seen as a ""wake-up call"" by every Albertan, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said Thursday at a new conference.

The province reported two more deaths on Thursday and 114 new cases of the illness.

""This needs to be a wake-up call,"" Hinshaw said. ""I am very concerned by these numbers.""

The use of acute-care beds to treat COVID-19 patients is approaching the highest number of admissions on any single day that Alberta has seen during the pandemic, Hinshaw said. The peak of 113 hospital admissions came on April 30. The peak usage of intensive-care beds came on May 1, when 23 patients were in ICU.

On Thursday, 106 people were being treated in hospital for the disease, with 21 of them in ICU beds.

""Two weeks ago, we had seven Albertans in the ICU,"" Hinshaw said. ""Now we have triple that number.

""This is also a reminder that severe outcomes are not limited to the elderly. Twenty-four of those currently in hospital are under the age of 60, including seven who are between the ages of 20 and 39.""

'Lower risk does not mean zero risk'

While younger people have a lower risk of severe outcomes, she said, lower risk does not mean zero risk. And young people are as much at risk as anyone of passing the virus on to others.

One out of 50 people aged 30 to 39 who were diagnosed with the illness required admission to hospital, Hinshaw said. For those aged 40 and 69, one in 20 required hospitalization. For the 70 to 79 age group, one in 10 people who caught the illness died. For those over 80, the odds of dying were one in four.

""Think about those you know who are over the age of 70 or 80,"" Hinshaw said. ""In my life, I have many dearly-loved family members and friends in this age group, and I would not want to gamble their lives with these odds.""

Those who are younger should remember that surviving the coronavirus can still be ""awful and life-changing,"" she said. ""There can be long-term damage, such as higher risk of diabetes, and lung damage that doesn't go away when the infection ends.

""Regardless of age, we don't yet know what impact COVID-19 will have on your lifelong health.""

Rural areas seeing numbers rise

Though Calgary's numbers have been climbing fastest in Alberta, even rural areas are seeing rising numbers, she said. The province's central zone, which has not seen high case numbers so far, now has 33 people in hospital, seven of them in the ICU.

""I believe the recent increase in numbers is in part reflective of the fact that fatigue has set in,"" Hinshaw said. ""After several months of not catching the virus, it is easy to say that you feel fine, so why wash your hands? Why stay two metres apart in public? Why avoid sharing food at a barbecue?""

Alberta has seen the number of active cases rise by more than 400 over the past week.

An Alberta Health update released on July 16 reported 854 active cases. The most recent update, released Thursday, reported 1,293 cases — an increase of 439.

The guidance issued by Alberta Health is intended as a manual for how to live with COVID-19 for the rest of this year and likely beyond, said Hinshaw, who admonished those who may not be paying attention.

""I think what we need to do right now is to make sure that people understand the guidance is not a list of suggestions that can be disregarded if they are inconvenient,"" she said. ""The message is clear. We need to learn from our own experiences and the experiences of others. We need to take current numbers as a warning and do what we need to do to prevent infections from spreading widely and quickly.

""We are all tired of COVID-19, but this virus doesn't care. We have no choice but to learn how to live with it.""

Whether case numbers go up or down in coming weeks will depend in large part on what precautions people take over the next ten to 14 days and beyond, Hinshaw said.

""The numbers of new cases we are seeing today reflect trends and behaviour one to two weeks ago. Even if we all implemented all public health guidance perfectly starting tomorrow, we will still likely have increased numbers for at least one to two more weeks.

To date, eight confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the Mohawk community, which straddles the Ontario, Quebec and New York State borders.

The new cases, which are being investigated by New York's Franklin County Public Health Department in conjunction with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, stem from a gathering and boat ride on July 10.

An asymptomatic non-resident transmitted the virus to a young community member, who subsequently passed the virus onto older family members, officials say.

One of the family members, whose identity was protected, published a self-report on the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's Facebook page this week.

""They are having a hard time, mentally and emotionally, since testing positive. The added speculation and rumours about my family, however, are making it unnecessarily harder,"" the individual wrote.

""We are very fortunate to be healthy at this time and are thankful for the support of our leadership and health officials. All I am asking for at this time is for some compassion for the difficult process anyone must endure after contracting the virus.""

Travel ban in effect

The Mohawk Council and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe said in a joint statement they are reminding community members to remain vigilant, exercise physical distancing and wear a mask in social situations.

""In the last three to four months, people in Akwesasne have worked hard to keep this COVID virus at bay,"" said Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe clinical director Dr. Benson Kelly, in a video message to the community this week.

""I know we like to socialize, see family members, especially elders. This is very dangerous. If you have family or friends coming from outside of the area who are planning on visiting, this might be a good time to postpone it to a later date.""

Both governments currently have a travel ban in effect for the territory's unique geographical challenges. Community members must also adhere to a travel ban that prohibits a 100-mile travel radius in the United States or 50 miles in Canada.

""You feel bad for him. He's a great player. The fans want to see him. And it affects our lineup,"" Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said as he announced Soto's test less than five hours before the 2019 World Series champions were scheduled to host the New York Yankees on opening day.

""But what can you do about it?"" Rizzo said. ""You've got to play ball. ... We're going to have to win without our best guy. It's a challenge.""

Soto, a 21-year-old left fielder who was a breakout star of last post-season, will be sidelined until he can come up negative on two consecutive coronavirus tests.

""He's asymptomatic,"" Rizzo said. ""He's following all major league protocols.""

Rizzo said the Nationals had done contact tracing to check whether other members of the organization had been exposed.

""At this time, there's nobody else unavailable because of the contact tracing,"" Rizzo said.

Soto had missed the first two weeks of the team's summer camp this month after he was exposed to someone with COVID-19.

In other moves as Washington set its 30-man opening day roster, outfielder Emilio Bonifacio's contract was selected, as were those of lefty Sam Freeman and righty Javy Guerra. Austin Voth, who entered spring training in a three-way competition for the lone unclaimed spot in the rotation, was listed by the Nationals as their fifth starter.

The other candidates were Erick Fedde, listed on Thursday's roster announcement as a reliever, and Joe Ross, who opted out of the 2020 season.

Also Thursday, Yankees second baseman DJ LeMahieu was reinstated from the COVID-19 injured list as New York set its roster before playing Game 1.

Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman and starter Masahiro Tanaka begin the season on injured lists — Chapman on the COVID IL, and Tanaka on the 7-day IL after getting hit in the head by a batted ball.

Manager Aaron Boone announced on July 4 that LeMahieu and right-hander Luis Cessa tested positive for the coronavirus before travelling to New York for the team's summer camp and said they were self-isolating at home.

LeMahieu signed with the Yankees before last season and hit .327, setting career highs with 26 homers and 102 RBIs. He was not in Thursday's starting lineup; Tyler Wade was playing second and batting ninth.

The Yankees also recalled infielder Thairo Estrada and righty pitchers Ben Heller and Michael King from the alternate site Thursday. That trio is part of a group of eight Yankees making their first career opening day active roster, along with starting third baseman Gio Urshela, outfielder Clint Frazier, infielder Mike Ford, catcher Kyle Higashioka and right-hander Jonathan Loaisiga.

Ford, who went to Princeton and showed some power when he was called up by New York in 2019, posted a message on Instagram, calling Thursday ""a very special moment for me.""

""I will finally be able to look at my name on an opening day lineup card in the big leagues. I know the rosters are expanded and it is a strange season, but it is one I will always remember,"" Ford's post said.

25391,2020-07-23 15:14,"'Not what we should be doing': Few masks, no social distancing at crowded Falls attractions","The scene in the video looks like a typical summer night at Clifton Hill — pre-COVID-19.

The popular Niagara Falls tourism promenade is packed with people standing in line for attractions, pushing strollers through the crowd, some holding balloons.

A few wear masks, but that's the only sign of the pandemic that's infected more than 800 people in the Niagara Region and killed 64.

The response to the video was swift.

Residents took to social media to share their shock at the lack of physical distancing and other measures to curb the spread of the virus. And, on Thursday, mayor Jim Diodati announced a new team of ambassadors who will patrol the area offering hand sanitizer, selling masks and reminding people to stay at least two metres apart.

The program will start immediately, he said, and each person will be wearing a highlighter yellow shirt bearing the words ""Crush the Curve.""

""There'll be dozens of them and they'll be on both sides of Clifton Hill, top to bottom,"" said Diodati.

The video, uploaded to YouTube by an account called Amusement Insiders, is titled ""SHUT DOWN Niagara Falls.""

Brendon Cross, whose email address is associated with the channel, confirmed it was recorded on July 18.

""Seeing the video was quite disappointing,"" said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, acting medical officer of health for Niagara.

""I think it's absolutely critical that people see this video and take note this is not what we should be doing.""

Hirji specifically pointed to the large gathers with a lack of physical distancing and noted ""extremely few people seem to be wearing face coverings,"" he said.

It's important that people wear masks, stay at least two metres apart and keep washing their hands, he said. Crowds run the risk of allowing the virus to spread and make it incredibly difficult to trace who may have been exposed in the event a positive case is present.

""This very much looks like people feel things have gone back to normal, the pandemic is over, we've beaten it, so they can go back to their previous behaviours,"" said Hirji.

Jim Taber said he first saw it shared on Facebook and though ""Wow, this is crazy.""

The 64-year-old and his wife retired and moved to Niagara Falls four years ago. They'd generally visit Clifton Hill at least twice a month, but that's stopped since the pandemic began.

""We avoid it pretty much like the plague,"" he said.

Go-karts shut down

Taber was especially struck by people ""lined up like cattle"" to get on the Niagara Speedway go-karts.

""You can clearly see that people are just not paying attention to distancing. There's no one wearing masks and I find it very disturbing.""

In fact, the go-karts were shut down Thursday after a track worker tested positive for COVID-19.

Joel Noden, director of marketing for HOCO Limited, said a teen, who would help check seatbelts and straighten karts that had spun out, called in sick on July 15th after working five shifts at the attraction.

The company found out about the positive test on Sunday, said Noden, and has since checked the security footage to track the workers movements and direct anyone who came into contact with him to isolate.

Masks are mandatory for all workers and the track was already cleaning helmets and sanitizing straps, so Noden said they're not worried about customers being exposed.

""When we spoke with the person from the health department they said the contact was so minimal and the precautions in place ... with the face coverings and everything,"" he said.

Diodati said he and his family actually drove past Clifton Hill on the day the video was shot and were struck by how busy it was.

Officials aren't sure why the spike in visitors happened, but the mayor said the falls were lit up to celebrate the 201 years of Columbian independence and that many people who came to see the display ended up at attractions afterwards.

The region relies heavily on tourism and has struggled during the pandemic, but Diodati said the video reminded him ""careful what you wish for.""

He admitted the city is still working on determining the best way to deal with crowds and noted Niagara Regional Council will be voting on a mandatory mask bylaw Thursday night.

In the meantime he's hopeful the ambassadors, who will be funded by the local tourism industry, will help protect visitors.

""We're going to focus on compliance rather than conviction to get the message out that we all have a responsibility to make sure the guests are safe, to make sure that the employees are safe and to make sure that our community is safe,"" he said.

For his part, Taber said he'll keep wearing a mask in public and plans to stay far from Clifton Hill and other local attractions until the virus is gone.

""The falls will be there when this is over. We'll go down then,"" he explained. ""But at our age if we catch COVID we run the risk of not being able to go down to the falls ever again.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/niagara-falls-tourism-clifton-hill-covid-1.5660425?cmp=rss,news,canada,hamilton
25389,2020-07-23 15:09,Judge orders Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen released from prison,"A judge ordered the release from prison of U.S. President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying the government retaliated against him for planning to release a book critical of Trump before November's election.

Michael Cohen's First Amendment rights were violated when he was ordered back to prison on July 9 after probation authorities said he refused to sign a form banning him from publishing the book or communicating publicly in other manners, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said during a telephone conference.

Hellerstein ordered Michael Cohen released from prison to home confinement by 2 p.m. on Friday.

""How can I take any other inference than that it's retaliatory?"" Hellerstein asked prosecutors, who insisted in court papers and again Thursday that Probation Department officers did not know about the book when they wrote a provision of home confinement that severely restricted Cohen's public communications.

""I've never seen such a clause in 21 years of being a judge and sentencing people and looking at terms of supervised release,"" the judge said. ""Why would the Bureau of Prisons ask for something like this ... unless there was a retaliatory purpose?""

In ruling, Hellerstein said he made the ""finding that the purpose of transferring Mr. Cohen from furlough and home confinement to jail is retaliatory."" He added: ""And it's retaliatory for his desire to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish the book.""

Book unflattering to Trump

Cohen, 53, sued federal prison officials and Attorney General William Barr on Monday, saying he was ordered back to prison because he was writing a book, Disloyal: The True Story of Michael Cohen, Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.

In a written declaration, Cohen said his book ""will provide graphic and unflattering details about the President's behaviour behind closed doors,"" including a description of anti-Semitic and ""virulently racist remarks"" against Black leaders including President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first Black president.

He said he worked openly on his manuscript until May at Otisville's prison library and discussed his book with prison officials. He said he was told in April that a lawyer for the Trump Organization, where he worked for a decade, was claiming he was barred from publishing his book by a non-disclosure agreement. Cohen disputes that.

Cohen has been in isolation at an Otisville, N.Y., prison camp, quarantined while prison authorities ensure he does not have the coronavirus.

'Victory for the First Amendment'

Prosecutors declined through a spokesperson to comment on Hellerstein's ruling.

Cohen's attorney, Danya Perry, said in a statement that Hellerstein's order was ""a victory for the First Amendment"" and showed that the government cannot block a book critical of the president as a condition of release to home confinement. ""This principle transcends politics and we are gratified that the rule of law prevails,"" she said.

Cohen was released in May along with other prisoners as authorities tried to slow the spread of the COVID-19 in federal prisons.

He was one year into a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, among other crimes.

25386,2020-07-23 15:05,"Watchdog to review conduct of U.S. federal agents in Portland, Washington protests","The U.S. Justice Department inspector general said Thursday that it will review the conduct of federal agents who responded to unrest in Portland, Ore., and Washington, following concerns from members of Congress and the public.

The watchdog investigation will examine use-of-force allegations in Portland, where the city's top federal prosecutor and mayor have publicly complained.

In Washington, investigators will look at the training and instruction provided to the federal agents who responded to protest activity at Lafayette Square, near the White House.

Among the questions being studied are whether the agents followed Justice Department guidelines, including on identification requirements and in the deployment of chemical agents and use of force.

The investigation was announced amid ongoing unrest in Portland, where Mayor Ted Wheeler was tear-gassed by federal agents as he stood outside the courthouse there.

WATCH | Mayor Ted Wheeler among those tear gassed in Portland:

During another night of protest against the presence of federal agents in Portland, Mayor Ted Wheeler was among those tear gassed by federal law enforcement. 0:48

Local authorities in both cities have complained that the presence of federal agents has exacerbated tensions on the streets, while residents have accused the government of violating their constitutional rights.

Civil unrest escalated in Portland after federal agents were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause. And in Washington, peaceful protesters were violently cleared from the streets by federal officers using tear gas.

The decision to dispatch federal agents to American cities is playing out at a hyper-politicized moment when Trump is grasping for a new re-election strategy after the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy, dismantling what his campaign had seen as his ticket to a second term.

Trump has seized on a moment of spiking violence in some cities, claiming it will only rise if his Democratic rival Joe Biden is elected in November and Democrats have a chance to make the police reforms they have endorsed after the killing of George Floyd and nationwide protests demanding racial justice.

25396,2020-07-23 15:04,"B.C. announces restrictions on rental properties, houseboats as COVID-19 cases rise","The latest:

30 new cases.

1 new death, in a long-term care home.

16 people in hospital.

3 people in intensive care.

304 cases remain active.

190 people have died.

2,898 people have recovered.

A new provincial health order will limit the number of people allowed at vacation rentals and on houseboats as COVID-19 cases continue to climb in B.C.

The order will apply to all rental properties, including services like Airbnb and house boat rentals provincewide.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says it will limit the number of guests allowed to stay in a vacation rental and will limit the capacity of people allowed on rental boats, including house boats. She says the limits will be based on the size of the vessel.

Henry did not say when the order will go into effect or provide specific numbers for what the limits would be but said health authorities are working with the industry to determine that.

The province is urging British Columbians to avoid gathering in large groups, and the new provincial health order aims to enforce that.

Henry described SARS-CoV-2 as a ""stealth virus"" with far-reaching impacts and serious consequences and warned being around large crowds puts everyone at risk.

The province flattened the curve of infection this spring, but the daily number of new COVID-19 cases in B.C. are creeping back up to a level not seen in months.

""We need you to keep your groups small,"" Henry said.

Cases trending up

On Wednesday, 34 new cases were announced as the province implemented new rules for restaurants, bars and nightclubs.

Under the new measures, all patrons in restaurants, bars and nightclubs will be required to be seated, alcohol self-service will not be available (that means no ordering from the bar), and dance floors will be closed.

Case counts have spiked in B.C. in recent days, with 102 new infections diagnosed between last Friday and Monday. Henry said 70 cases have been linked to events and parties in Kelowna over the past several weeks.

Close to 1,000 British Columbians are currently in self-isolation.

""It shows us the actions of a few… can cause a tremendous impact,"" Henry said Thursday.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said the past two weeks have delivered some ""hard lessons."" He's urging British Columbians to continue following protocols that flattened the curve: hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask.

""Wearing a mask does not take away the obligation to physically distance,"" he added.

On Thursday, Premier John Horgan urged British Columbians to not backslide on progress made so far.

He made it clear he's concerned about recent case counts stemming from parties in Kelowna, and a large drum circle at a Vancouver beach earlier this week.

""Come on. You're better than that. We need bigger spaces and fewer faces,"" he said.

""The challenge ahead of us is enormous. COVID-19 is still very much in our community and we have a collective responsibility to do what we can to defeat it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid19-bc-update-july-23-1.5660471?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia

25375,2020-07-23 14:02,The champs are back: Leaner Raptors focusing on another title run,"Nick Nurse might not have been the best student in college, at least when it came to being able to get work done ahead of time.

By his own admission, he would start big projects such as papers a couple days before they were due. He likes to cram information, which is why the Toronto Raptors coach might be perfectly suited for basketball inside a bubble during a pandemic.

At Walt Disney World, he's spending his downtime — and there is a lot of it — studying film. There's a championship to resume defence of in a week or so, and Nurse sounds like he'll be ready.

""I didn't watch a ton during the pandemic, to be honest. ... So, I'm watching a lot more tape now that the games are approaching,"" Nurse said.

He's doing the bulk of his work now, coming up with the sort of ideas that helped Toronto win its first title a little over a year ago. Some of his key players have been getting big-time work in throughout the league shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic — point guard Kyle Lowry looks slimmer, centre Marc Gasol looks much slimmer. And if the Raptors are going to make another deep playoff run, those veterans will likely be big reasons why.

""It's clearly Kyle's team,"" Nurse said. ""His care factor is way up there. His intelligence factor is way up. We're in good hands with him being the leader of this team. When a guy plays the way he does, the leadership by example ... that phrase is probably overused, but it's certainly the case.""

The Raptors were amused earlier this season when the widespread belief was that losing reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard in free agency to the Los Angeles Clippers doomed their hopes for another strong season.

Those whispers are long gone. The Raptors come into the restart holding the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference, and probably can't fall past the No. 3 seed no matter what happens in the eight seeding games.

""We just want to play,"" Raptors forward Pascal Siakam said. ""I miss playing basketball.""

Basketball is back. So are the champs, who do not intend to yield their spot atop the league easily.

Healthy approach

The long break should help Gasol, who battled left hamstring trouble after a lengthy 2019 in which he won his first NBA championship and then led Spain to the world basketball title. He missed 15 games after he was hurt Jan. 28, returned for one brief appearance and then sat out again in the final game before the stoppage.

Press play

The Raptors had just finished a five-game trip to the West, winning the final four, when the season was suspended. They are on pace for a better record than their championship team that finished with a .707 winning percentage. They are at .719 — and if Toronto goes 6-2 or better in the seeding games, this team will finish with the best single-season winning percentage in Raptors history. That mark of 59-23 (.720) was set by the team that went to the East semifinals two years ago.

Team approach

Of the nine teams at Disney from the Eastern Conference, the Raptors are the only team that has a different leader in five different stat totals — points (Siakam), rebounds (Serge Ibaka), assists (Lowry), steals (Fred VanVleet) and blocks (Chris Boucher). In the West, among the 13 teams from that side of the league at the restart, Phoenix and New Orleans also have five different players leading in those categories.

More to come

Siakam was the NBA's Most Improved Player last season. This season he's averaging career highs of 23.6 points and 7.5 rebounds. He's in line to become the third Raptors player ever to finish a season averaging at least 23 points and seven rebounds, joining only Chris Bosh in 2009-10 and Leonard last season.

Numbers game

The magic number for the Raptors this season has been 44%. When Toronto shoots at least 44 per cent from the field, it has gone 36-4. In games where it doesn't hit that mark, the record is 10-14. And in the two seasons under Nurse, including playoffs, the Raptors are 65-6 when shooting 48 per cent or better — with four of those six losses coming in games decided by two points or less.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/nba-toronto-raptors-restart-preview-1.5660481?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,nba
25364,2020-07-23 14:00,"Gen. Jonathan Vance, chief of the defence staff, announces retirement","Gen. Jonathan Vance, the country's top military commander, has announced his retirement.

A letter informing the troops of his planned departure was posted on social media Thursday. It says that he's informed the Governor General, the prime minister and the defence minister of his decision ""to relinquish command of the Canadian Armed Forces in the months to come.""

He said it will be up to the government to select a new chief of the defence staff and decide when the change of command will take place.

Vance has held the post for just over five years — often tumultuous ones — making him one of the longest serving defence chiefs in the country's history.

He was appointed in 2015 by then-prime minister Stephen Harper.

His tenure was marked by a high-profile campaign to stamp out sexual misconduct in the military and the politically-charged case involving former vice-admiral Mark Norman, who was accused of leaking cabinet secrets to a Quebec shipyard and the media.

Within some political and defence circles, Vance was accused of not doing enough to stand up for Norman, his former vice-chief of the defence staff, in the face of the allegations. The criminal case against Norman was stayed after the defence dug up evidence that the RCMP and the Crown had not considered.

Throughout the controversies, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said repeatedly that he had full confidence in Vance, who was also assigned the thorny task of implementing the Liberal government's defence policy.

'I am so very proud'

Vance has been touted as a possible candidate to head NATO's Military Council, a position that has not been held by a Canadian for more than 15 years.

The chairman's post is expected to become vacant next year and the NATO alliance has been actively canvassing nations with an interest in leading the advisory body.

But the Liberal government last week formally refused to put Vance's name forward, defence sources told CBC News.

In his letter to the troops, Vance praised them and described them as ""the inspiration for my life,"" saying he had given them his all.

He told Canadian Forces members that they are ""more important to the success of this nation than ‎most will ever know, and I am so very proud to be counted among your ranks.""

25390,2020-07-23 13:51,"Suncor CEO encouraged by Trans Mountain pipeline, less sure of Keystone XL's completion","The chief executive of one of the country's largest energy companies has more faith in the federal government's Trans Mountain expansion project being completed, compared with the Keystone XL pipeline, which has Alberta government backing.

That's based on comments by Suncor Energy's Mark Little on Thursday morning during a conference call with the investment community about the plethora of pipeline developments recently, including regulatory and court decisions.

Little was encouraged about the Trans Mountain expansion project, which recently cleared a major court hurdle when the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by First Nations in B.C. Construction in Alberta and British Columbia continues on the pipeline, which will transport oil from Edmonton to the Vancouver area.

""Trans Mountain is looking better than it ever has,"" he said. ""They're talking about it being on in late 2022. If it's 2022 or out to mid-2023, it's in good shape.""

About the prospects of Keystone XL, Little sounded less optimistic.

Earlier this month, a U.S. Supreme Court decision supported a lower court ruling that blocked a key environmental permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline — a decision that will continue to delay large portions of construction on the 1,947-kilometre project that stretches from Alberta to the U.S. gulf coast.

Asked by an analyst during the conference call to assess various pipeline projects, Little chuckled as he brought up Keystone XL.

""And then Keystone XL,"" he laughed. ""I don't know, seems like it's becoming a significant part of the discussion on the politics side.""

Listen to the analyst's question followed by Mark Little's response about recent pipeline developments:

The latest court ruling is just another setback for the project, which was first announced in 2008 and is being built by Calgary-based TC Energy Corp.

""[TC Energy is] working through these latest court rulings, so it's delaying any of the construction across the waterways, but I think if you go talk to TC, they're still plowing ahead and working hard to make this thing happen, so there's lots of resolve there to keep going,"" Little said.

Some experts have said there is less than a 50 per cent chance the project is actually completed, especially considering the U.S. presidential election later this year.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been a strong supporter of the Keystone XL project, but his opponent, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, has said he would tear up Trump's approval of the pipeline if he wins the White House.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has praised the project for the potential job creation in the province and the additional export capacity it would provide to oil producers.

The Alberta government has invested $1.5 billion in the Keystone XL pipeline, plus $6 billion in loan guarantees.

TC Energy has said it will continue building the Canadian leg of the project while fighting the legal battle south of the border.

25405,2020-07-23 13:06,Manitoba will stop identifying when COVID-19 cases are on colonies after Hutterites say they're being profiled,"Manitoba health officials will no longer announce when newly identified COVID-19 cases in the province are connected to Hutterite colonies, unless there's a risk to public health, Dr. Brent Roussin said on Thursday.

The change comes a day after the minister of a southwestern Manitoba colony suggested he might file a human rights complaint against the province if health officials continued the practice.

Paul Waldner, minister of the CanAm Hutterite Colony, said for Hutterites in Manitoba facing stigma, the damage is already done.

""The government should really almost [make] a public statement and say, 'We were wrong here,'"" Waldner said after the province changed course on the issue Thursday afternoon.

""People now think that because [some Hutterites] have it, they can't associate with us, there's something wrong with us.""

He said it will likely take some time for Hutterite colonies in Manitoba to escape the stigma from the COVID-19 cases associated with their communities.

In a letter sent to Premier Brian Pallister and Health Minister Cameron Friesen on Wednesday, Waldner asked the province to identify only the geographic location of new cases of the illness caused by the new coronavirus, instead of a colony in that location.

Otherwise, the colony planned to file a complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, the letter said.

In some announcements this month, health officials decided to specify which cases were on colonies because news reports had already said there were cases in those communities, Manitoba's chief public health officer said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.

The province's intention was to list the cases generally as clusters unless there's a risk to public health — which is what it plans to do from now on, Dr. Roussin said.

Roussin said he did not know if the one new case announced in Manitoba Thursday — a man in his 40s in the Interlake-Eastern Health region — was connected to a Hutterite colony.

He said it's important to be wary of perpetuating stigma attached to the illness.

""At first, we saw a lot of stigma against Asian Canadians,"" Roussin said. ""Now, we see stigma against Hutterites for this. And it's not useful, it's not appropriate and it actually hinders public health's ability to control this virus.""

Hutterites are among the first to offer to help in times of need, Waldner said, pointing to face masks colonies made and donated a few months ago and vegetables they donate to soup kitchens every year.

""My dad did it when I grew up. We continue the traditions. We don't want praise. We just want to be part of society,"" he said. ""[Now], we're being painted with a brush, with one stroke, as being something different.""

5 of 120 colonies affected

On Wednesday afternoon, seven more cases of COVID-19 on Hutterite colonies were identified in Manitoba, bringing the total number of cases in those communities in the province to 35.

In addition to experiencing cultural profiling at medical and dental offices, Hutterites in Manitoba have been refused service at physical and massage therapy clinics and retail stores, the Hutterian Safety Council said in a statement on Thursday morning.

Since the first case of COVID-19 on a Hutterite colony in Manitoba was confirmed on July 13, people in five of the province's more than 120 communities have tested positive, the statement said.

Upwards of 20 colonies in the province have now restricted travel in their communities to only essential trips, and many have increased santization protocols and established alternatives to communal meals and church services for elderly and vulnerable members, the safety council said.

Some Hutterites who tested positive for COVID-19 only have minor symptoms and are self-isolating at home. None are children, the statement said.

The council also said there is a clear link between the cases on colonies in Manitoba and travel to Alberta and Saskatchewan, though it reiterated that council members don't believe there's a link to a funeral on a colony in Alberta last month.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/hutterite-colonies-manitoba-covid-19-discrimination-1.5660328?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba

25369,2020-07-23 13:00,Whitecaps conjure up key win to advance at MLS tournament,"Substitutes Yordy Reyna and Cristian Dajome scored second-half goals after a lengthy weather delay Thursday as the depleted Vancouver Whitecaps conjured up an unlikely 2-0 victory over Chicago Fire SC to advance at the MLS is Back Tournament.

The Whitecaps, who had lost their first two matches, needed to win by two goals or more to leapfrog Chicago on goal difference in Group B and move on to the round of 16 as one of the four best third-place finishers.

The Fire briefly had a lifeline in the 84th minute when C.J. Sapong knocked the ball in after Alvaro Medran's shot hammered off the crossbar. But, after video review, the goal was waved off for handball.

Chicago had just needed a win to move past Seattle into second place but could still have advanced with a tie or even a one-goal loss in which it scored at least once.

San Jose had already clinched top spot in the group.

Vancouver looked anything but threatening for the first hour Thursday. Then, with the game scoreless 0-0 in the 63rd minute, the game was halted for 90 minutes as lightning threatened ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex.

A different Whitecaps team came out from the dressing room.

Less than two minutes after play resumed, Reyna broke the deadlock. Ali Adnan found Reyna behind the defence and the Peruvian international sidestepped goalkeeper Kenneth Kronholm before slipping the ball in. It was Vancouver's first shot on target.

Dajome made it 2-0 in the 71st as the Chicago defence was carved open again. Reyna found Dajome, who slotted the ball past Kronholm with his team's second shot on net.

Slovenian international Robert Beric had a gilt-edged chance for Chicago in the 78th minute but skied the ball from right in front on goal.

Playing their third games in eight days, the Whitecaps had shown little in the first half, outclassed and outshot 10-1 (3-0 in shots on target). Already missing nine players through injury or other reasons, Vancouver lost defender Jasser Khmiri late in the first half with a left knee injury after going down in a tangle with a Fire player near the sideline.

Vancouver coach Marc Dos Santos switched from a 4-4-2 formation to 5-3-2 with five Canadians in his starting 11, including forwards Ryan Raposo and Theo Bair.

The team announced its 30-man roster Thursday along with a long list of moves ahead of Friday's season opener at Tampa Bay.

Meanwhile, reports have the Blue Jays exploring both Baltimore and Washington D.C. has potential places to play their home games.

MLB.com reported the team was in discussions to play the majority of their scheduled home games in Baltimore at Camden Yards, home of the Orioles, pending approval of state legislators, while the Athletic suggested National Park in D.C., home to the Nationals as a possible landing spot.

After Toronto denied its home team permission to play baseball there this season, the Blue Jays appeared to be headed to Pittsburgh, playing at PNC Park when the Pirates are not scheduled to be home.

As for Pearson, the Blue Jays gain an extra year of contractual control if he is not on the roster for the first week of the season. Catcher Caleb Joseph joined Pearson on the taxi squad along with left-hander Ryan Borucki, who was optioned to the team's alternate training site.

The regular season was trimmed from 162 to 60 games this year due to the pandemic. The taxi squad gives teams an immediate option to replace a player due to injury or a positive COVID-19 test.

The Blue Jays also selected right-hander A.J. Cole and left-hander Brian Moran to the major-league roster. Right-handers Thomas Hatch and Jacob Waguespack, infielder Santiago Espinal and left-hander Anthony Kay also made the cut after all four players were recalled.

25356,2020-07-23 12:47,Twitter sees drop in revenue but surge of new users,"The global pandemic and U.S. protests are forcing a pullback by advertisers on Twitter, but it's also led to an unprecedented surge of users.

Average daily user growth spiked 34 per cent in the second quarter, the company said Thursday, the largest jump in users ever recorded by the company.

But the company took a huge tax hit to earnings, posting a net loss of $1.2 billion US, or $1.56 per share, in the April-June period, compared with a profit of $1.1 billion US, or $1.43 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue fell by about one-fifth to $683 million US, far short of the $702 million Wall Street had expected, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet.

Twitter's advertising business was hit harder than its larger rivals Google and Facebook, and analysts had expected the bleeding to continue in the second quarter. The company said ad revenue made a ""gradual, moderate recovery"" relative to levels in March but many brands then slowed or paused their spending in late May to mid-June, following the surge of Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S.

""We continue to see headwinds from lower global advertising demand due to COVID and civil unrest,"" CEO Jack Dorsey said.

Ad revenue fell 15 per cent in the last three weeks of June, which was better than the 27 per cent decline in the final three weeks of March, with advertiser demand returning as the protests subsided, chief financial officer Ned Segal said in the earnings call.

Twitter also said it was exploring ""subscriptions and other approaches to complement our advertising business,"" though it was not expecting any revenue to result this year. Dorsey said on the call that the company would have a ""really high bar for when we would ask consumers to pay for aspects of Twitter.""

New users have been flocking to the platform as they isolate, with the number of daily active users jumping to 186 million.

""Twitter's strength as a news and entertainment source has helped buoy engagement during the pandemic as housebound consumers use the platform for real-time news and information,"" said eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. But she does not expect this to continue as stay-at-home restrictions begin to lift and people start returning to more normal routines.

Dorsey feels 'terrible' about worldwide hack

In the earnings call, Dorsey also addressed an embarrassing hacking incident last week that compromised the accounts of high-profile users, saying he felt ""terrible"" about it.

That hack targeted 130 accounts, including world leaders, celebrities and tech moguls, and appeared designed to lure their Twitter followers into sending money to an anonymous Bitcoin account. The company revealed more details Wednesday, saying hackers accessed the direct message inboxes of 36 accounts, including an elected Dutch official. It didn't identify the official, but Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders said it was him.

""Last week was a really tough week for all of us at Twitter,"" Dorsey said. ""We feel terrible about the security incident that negatively affected the people we serve and their trust in us.""

Twitter executives deflected questions on another challenge: a social media ad boycott running for at least the month of July, and therefore not counted in the second quarter. Facebook is the primary target of the boycott by hundreds of advertisers over its policies and actions on hate speech and misinformation.

The boycott's effect on Twitter is less clear, with some advertisers pausing ads on all social media, though some analysts believe some ad dollars could be redirected away from Facebook to Twitter.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/twitter-revenue-drop-1.5660229?cmp=rss,news,business,
25359,2020-07-23 12:22,Seattle NHL expansion franchise reveals 'Kraken' as team name,"The NHL's newest team finally has its name: the Seattle Kraken.

The expansion franchise unveiled its nickname Thursday, ending 19 months of speculation about whether the team might lean traditional or go eccentric with the name for the league's 32nd team.

""The Kraken is a name born of the fans. It was suggested and championed by the fans,"" Seattle CEO Tod Leiweke said.

In opting for the sea creature of Scandinavian folklore, Seattle bypassed options like Sockeyes, Evergreens or Metropolitans, the last of which would have been a nod to Seattle's hockey history. There was even a push from some fans for the team to try to acquire the Thunderbirds name from the local junior team.

But Kraken was a clear favourite among fans, who rallied around the name soon after the expansion franchise was awarded in December 2018. The enthusiasm has grown since as the team built toward its debut for the 2021-22 season.

It's edgy and sounds menacing. And it gave the franchise a clear brand going forward.

'Authentic and noble'

""I think that we felt like this is so authentic and noble, and we hit all the main things that we really wanted that we feel really strongly that this is the right choice,"" Heidi Dettmer, Seattle's vice-president of marketing, told The Associated Press. ""I've totally fallen in love with this brand and I think our fans will.""

Seattle also unveiled its primary colours, which will be a deep dark blue — almost black — and a lighter shade of blue as a complement.

Seattle fan Max Rubin, despite his NY Islanders jersey, showed his support for the Kraken name when the team's expansion was announced in 2018. (Associated Press)

Unlike with the last NHL expansion team in Las Vegas, there should be no trademark issues with Kraken. The Vegas Golden Knights ran into problems with the U.S. Army and it took several years for the trademark battle to be settled.

The unveiling of Seattle's name has been expected for months, only to have it run into delays. It was first thought to be targeted for late last year in the hope of products hitting the market prior to the holiday season.

Then the NHL All-Star break in January was thought to be a possibility. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, where the initial epicenter in the U.S. was the Seattle area.

SIMILAR]

Dettmer said the name itself was chosen right around the first of the year. The time since has been spent on finalizing the primary and secondary logos while working with the league's uniform provider, Adidas.

Nic Corbett, the director of NHL relations with Adidas, said the primary logo is a Kraken tentacle shaped into an `S' and is a nod to the Seattle Metropolitans logo. The Metropolitans were the first American team to win the Stanley Cup in 1917.

""We needed a mark that was noble and (Seattle GM) Ron Francis was someone who kept hitting that home,"" Corbett told the AP. ""It has to be noble, it has to be strong.""

Brugel successfully presented her case about why 2019 memoir We Have Always Been Here — in which Canadian journalist, photographer and activist Habib chronicles her childhood in Pakistan, her experience with religious persecution, her arrival to Canada as a child refugee and her journey of coming out as a proud queer Muslim woman — is the one book that will bring Canada into focus.

Brugel won in a 4-1 vote on the final day.

"" Samra 's writing is intelligent, raw and ultimately life-affirming. She bravely tackles her own experience with sexual assault, homophobia, religious persecution and Islamophobia in such a compassionate, accessible way that it compels us to tackle our own hardships with similar grace,"" Brugel said during the Canada Reads 2020 finale.

Brugel was steadfast in her passionate defence of the book during Canada Reads 2020. She noted how, while all five of the contending books dealt with important issues, she felt We Have Always Been Here is the one book that best fits Canada Reads 2020 theme of ""one book to bring Canada into focus.""

""With the recent global conversations about the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as every other marginalized group that has been forced to live in the shadows, Canadians have very quickly realized that we're not all that inclusive,"" said Brugel on Day One of the debates.

"" We Have Always Been Here …will bring Canada into focus right now because it finally acknowledges so many of our own communities that, up until now we have been just too complacent to investigate. LGBTQ lives, refugee lives, Muslim lives: in one fell swoop it gently educates its reader about the complexities of our differences all the while guiding us to the triumphant conclusion that, at our core, we are all the same.""

As Brugel said during the event, the memoir is a powerful reminder of the everyday struggles that all Canadians face in finding their own identity and place in the world.

""What makes this memoir great is the sheer amount of individuals it speaks to, particularly the individuals that aren't used to being acknowledged. For me, We Have Always Been Here was like reading the private diary of a soulmate that I had yet to meet. Samra's prose is both lyrical and smart without being too overly written. Every sentence is carefully constructed to be beautiful even when describing ugly situations. Her displays of vulnerability and honesty become contagious because she encourages herself as well as our audience to come out of hiding — to forgive yourself for not conforming — in order to find inner peace,"" Brugel said on Day Two of the debates.

25357,2020-07-23 12:14,Lake Louise ski resort loses appeal of $2M fine for cutting endangered trees,"An Alberta judge has upheld a $2.1-million fine against a world-renowned ski resort for cutting down endangered trees nearly seven years ago.

Lake Louise Ski Resort pleaded guilty in 2017 to taking down a stand of trees, including 38 endangered whitebark pine, along a ski run in 2013.

The fine, which was imposed a year later for charges under the Species at Risk Act and the Canada National Parks Act, amounted to roughly $55,000 a tree.

Fine was 'grossly disproportional,' lawyer argues

Lake Louise's lawyer argued the fine was 'grossly disproportional and demonstrably unfit' as a result of remediation efforts the resort took after the trees were cut down.

He asked for the court to either stay the charges or reduce the penalty to $200,000.

The resort has taken steps to ensure no other whitebark pine are cut down. Staff are better educated and the 7,000 whitebark pine within the resort area are now marked.

But the Appeal judge rejected the request and said the trial judge did not make an error handing out the fine.

""The penalties imposed by the sentencing judge for these offences were certainly more than a slap on the wrist,"" wrote Justice Barbara Romaine in a decision released Wednesday.

""An observer, uninformed of the circumstances of the case, may consider the penalties to be excessively high given that the offence involved flora and not animals,"" she said.

But, Romaine said, this was not a case of an ""otherwise good environmental citizen making an isolated mistake"".

""A mid-sized corporation operating in a national park failed to train and inform employees, leading to the destruction of a number of individuals of an endangered species whose extinction would have impact throughout the subalpine ecosystem,"" she wrote.

The agreed statement of facts in the case said that in 2013 a trail crew, consisting of six employees including a supervisor, began cleaning up, doing fence work and trimming and removing some trees on Ptarmigan Ridge at the ski resort.

Workers cut trees without permit

The document said that in late September of that year, the workers cut down a number of trees, including the whitebark pine, without a permit.

The five-needle whitebark pine provides food and habitat for animals, as well as helps stabilize steep subalpine slopes.

The trees exist at high elevations in western North America at, or close to, the treeline. They have been growing on the continent for 100,000 years and can grow to be between 500 and 1,000 years old.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/lake-louise-ski-resort-loses-appeal-2m-fine-cutting-endangered-trees-1.5660262?cmp=rss,news,canada,calgary
25373,2020-07-23 12:05,Pandemic pressure getting to you? Try an Icelandic scream,"If the worries, restrictions and uncertainties of the pandemic are stressing you out, you might want to try an Icelandic scream.

A new campaign is inviting people from all over the world to let out a yowl into Iceland's isolated, idyllic landscapes — all from the comfort of your own home.

Over the last few months, many people have been feeling the pressure of being stuck inside their homes in cramped, small spaces, said Eliza Reid, Iceland's First Lady. She's a spokesperson for Promote Iceland, a public-private marketing organization, and she is originally from Ottawa.

""You need some kind of release for it. And so the idea here is that you're able to just release that scream out into empty, Icelandic nature,"" Reid said on Ottawa Morning Thursday.

Eliza Reid, First Lady of iceland, is encouraging people to release their screams of frustration into the country's wide open spaces.

All you have to do is record your own scream on the campaign's website, Looks Like You Need Iceland, and it will be broadcast using speakers into the peaceful Icelandic hinterlands. Screamers can choose among seven locations around the country, from fjords to fishing villages, which they can watch via webcam.

The hope is that screamers who want to unleash their frustrations on Iceland's wild landscape will take in the beauty of the country, and ""when people feel safe and ready to travel, they think of Iceland,"" said Reid, ""in the future, when the situation is different.""

Although Iceland is open to visitors with some restrictions, she acknowledged not many people feel safe travelling at the moment.

Reid said she hasn't unleashed her own scream into the wild, but her children were excited about the project, and they've been eager participants. ""They just tried to do the best straight-up scream that they could do, and I've got to say, they're pretty good at it.""

Her family had planned to travel back to Ottawa for a visit this summer, but instead they are spending time exploring Iceland. The coronavirus has had a big impact on the tourism industry in there, she said, adding that she's happy to see many Icelanders taking tours and staying in hotels to support the local economy.

Please ""scream responsibly."" Reid said there are filters in place to ensure people are acting appropriately and not abusing the Icelandic landscape. (Eleanor Wachtel/CBC)

For those worried about noise pollution in Iceland, Reid said the speakers are quite small, and they're in fairly isolated areas, so they're not disturbing people in those locations.

To discourage people from abusing the project, she said the website asks people to ""scream responsibly"" but there is also a profanity filter in place, and a delay in posting to screen out any bad-language screams.

The campaign launched earlier this month and ends on July 29.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/icelandic-campaign-encourages-stress-relief-by-screaming-1.5660099?cmp=rss,news,canada,ottawa

25352,2020-07-23 11:06,"1.4 million Americans sought jobless benefits last week, up for 1st time since March","The number of laid-off Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose last week for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic struck in March, evidence of the deepening economic pain the outbreak is causing to the U.S. economy.

Weekly jobless claims rose to 1.4 million, underscoring the outsized role the unemployment insurance system is playing among U.S. safety net programs — just when a $600 weekly federal aid payment for people without jobs is set to expire at the end of this week.

Last week's pace of unemployment applications was up from 1.3 million the previous week. Before the pandemic, the number of weekly applications had never exceeded 700,000.

The U.S. Labour Department said Thursday that roughly 32 million people are receiving unemployment benefits, though that figure could include double-counting by some states. Some economists say the figure is likely closer to 25 million.

An additional 975,000 applied for jobless aid under a separate program that has made self-employed and gig workers eligible for the first time. That figure isn't adjusted for seasonal trends, so it's reported separately.

The resurgence of confirmed viral cases across the country has forced some businesses to close a second time or to impose tighter restrictions on customers in response to state mandates. The resulting pullback in business activity has hindered job growth and likely forced additional layoffs.

Combining aid packages

The federal government's $600 weekly benefit for laid-off workers, which is in addition to whatever jobless aid a state provides, is the last major source of economic help from the $2 trillion relief package that Congress approved in March. A small business lending program and a one-time $1,200 payment have largely run their course.

Members of Congress are negotiating another aid package that might extend the $600 benefit, though likely at a lower level. With state aid packages combined with the $600 weekly federal benefit, research shows roughly two-thirds of unemployed people are receiving more in aid than they earned at their former jobs — a finding that's led Republicans to argue that it is discouraging people from returning to work.

Yet the additional money has also been a key source of support for people who lost jobs that no longer exist or who fear being infected by the virus if they return to work.

The federal jobless aid has also helped protect the U.S. economy. Unemployment aid accounted for six per cent of all U.S. income in May, a greater share than even Social Security. Economists say it's one reason why retail spending rebounded as quickly as it did in May and June, helping fuel a modest economic rebound.

The economic impact of rising cases

With confirmed cases of the coronavirus having risen in 46 states compared with two weeks ago, economists say they're increasingly worried that any recovery is now in jeopardy. Twenty-two states have paused or reversed the reopening of businesses, according to economists at Bank of America.

Real-time measures of the economy suggest that companies are pulling back on hiring and that more small businesses are closing permanently. Credit card spending has been stuck at about 10 per cent below year-ago levels for nearly a month, according to JPMorgan Chase, after having risen steadily from mid-April to mid-June.

In May and June, businesses had rehired enough to more than offset the wave of layoffs. But the Census data now suggests that the economy is losing jobs again.

According to data from the consumer-review website Yelp, nearly 73,000 small businesses have closed for good since the pandemic intensified in March, up 28 per cent from mid-June.

""Every time a business closes, that makes the recovery longer and harder, so that worries me,"" said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at the investment bank Evercore ISI.

People deciding which bills to pay

Many jobless Americans say they fear that a slow and prolonged recovery would be hard to survive without the $600 weekly aid from the federal government. If that payment were eliminated, total unemployment benefits would shrink by one-half to two-thirds, depending on a recipient's state.

Melissa Bennett has been using the federal jobless benefit to help pay her $1,900 monthly health insurance bill, which she's paid on her own since losing her employer-sponsored plan in June. That's when she was laid off from her front desk job at a vacation time-share rental in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a beach town that has become a COVID-19 hot spot.

Without the $600, her unemployment benefit will fall to just $200 a week, and she'll have to decide whether to pay her mortgage or her utilities first.

Many analysts say they worry that the expiration of the federal payments will cause a wave of evictions of renters who won't be able to afford their monthly payments. Even before the pandemic, spiking rents in most major cities were squeezing the finances of lower-income families.

One in four renters — 11 million households — were spending more than half their income on rent before the recession, said Priscilla Aldomovar, CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit group focused on affordable housing.

Enterprise owns 13,000 rental units, and Aldomovar said that so far, the renters have largely kept up with their payments, which she attributes to the federal aid.

25349,2020-07-23 10:02,Giants coach Alyssa Nakken's long walk to 1st base historic step for women in baseball,"Alyssa Nakken and Antoan Richardson took a walk to have a candid heart-to-heart chat, making their way around a back field at Scottsdale Stadium for close to 45 minutes one March day just before baseball got shut down by the coronavirus.

""Look, let's not fool ourselves, you're not ready,"" Richardson told Nakken.

Unfazed, the two Giants coaches vowed to get back to work and go even harder, to focus on all she does well and realize the importance of acknowledging the things she doesn't know — or at least not yet.

So when Nakken took over for Richardson coaching first base Monday night during an exhibition game in Oakland, the moment meant so much to each of them.

""I'm getting goosebumps right now. The road that we've travelled and some of the conversations that we've had to get to that point were really fulfilling, just kind of watching her grow and learn over the past couple of months has just been really cool,"" Richardson said Wednesday by phone from Los Angeles. ""The time that she put in to learn the craft over the time that we weren't on the field I'm seeing that pay off for her, which is really cool to see. We've talked about her readiness.""

Nakken is now handling a variety of tasks for the Giants, so busy gearing up for the season she has little time to relish in the history of it all.

She's the first female on a major league coaching staff and even worked at first base for part of Monday's exhibition game in Oakland, then started at the spot a night later in San Francisco.

""You feel a sense of pride to be out there,"" the 30-year-old Nakken said of becoming the first woman in major league history to coach on the field. ""Me personally it's the best place to watch a game, that's for sure.""

By first pitch of Thursday night's season opener at Dodger Stadium, Nakken will be back behind the scenes making sure bench players stay ready in the batting cage and talking base-running and outfield defence. Richardson is the regular first base coach.

He pushed her this week to spend some innings at first in his place, and it proved valuable experience for the former college softball star.

""I'm still wrapping my head around it all. I was always preparing and staying ready for whatever position I would be put in,"" Nakken said. ""We've talked about this opportunity before but it kind of came quick. I was ready to go when Antoan Richardson encouraged me to go out there. It's an awesome feeling to be out there.""

As it prepares to resume during the pandemic, Major League Baseball is also wrestling with the legacy of a cheating scandal involving World Series champions, the Houston Astros. 8:21

She also sat in on some meetings with players telling them they made the team and to pack their bags for the road to face the rival Dodgers as the delayed 60-game season finally starts.

Nakken, with that long blonde braid swinging beneath her batting helmet, already made history when Gabe Kapler hired her to his big league coaching staff in January.

""I keep continuing to remind Alyssa that as she represents herself she represents a lot of people and a lot of hope,"" Richardson said. ""I always challenge her to not just think about not just how every decision affects you but how does it affect the other people that are impacted by every move that you make.

""Sometimes it is a lot, a big responsibility, but she has made a commitment to take that head on. She recognizes every day that the conversation she has with me impacts the next woman who has an opportunity to do something, it doesn't even have to be in baseball. Just really proud to see her take that responsibility on, and take it on with pride and I keep saying the word, with dignity. She really honours those that she stands for.""

At Sacramento State from 2009-2012, Nakken was a three-time all-conference player and four-time Academic All American. She went on to earn a master's degree in sport management from the University of San Francisco in 2015.

""One of the best things about Antoan is how dedicated he is to developing our staff,"" Kapler said. ""I've always believed that it's easy for coaches to remember to develop players, but it can be harder to remember to give that same effort to the people you work side by side with every day. Antoan never forgets that and gives 100 per cent to everyone he works with, and it unquestionably makes us better as a group.""

That conversation four months ago certainly helped in the growth process.

""Just kind of aired it out, really shared and got below the surface a little bit on what was going on, some of the challenges and really had an honest conversation about the job,"" Richardson said. ""I think we just learned a lot about each other and we learned how much we cared, one, about what we're working with but also how we cared about people around us and how we wanted to help each other grow in this opportunity.""

Nakken is so appreciative of both Richardson and Kapler for encouraging her and pushing her to keep making strides forward.

""I don't know exactly how the conversations went between he and Kap but they both are very encouraged by people taking steps to develop,"" Nakken said. ""So I'm pretty sure Kap was all in on that when Antoan went with him with some confidence that I could do it.""

""We are sad to have to announce that based on the province of Ontario's framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the state of emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled,"" a newsletter posting said.

""As a result, we must cancel all performances and public events through Sept. 15.""

The festival also added that the ""further delay"" has forced the cancellation of most of the 2020 productions.

A few remaining productions after Sept. 16 have not been cancelled in the hopes that the festival can welcome back audiences to reduced capacity theatres. Those shows include performances of Charley's Aunt, Flush, and A Christmas Carol.

Cancelled productions include Gypsy, The Devil's Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven's Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl.

The festival said that the company had been looking forward to the season, and that people are ""hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience.""

""It's devastating to have had to put the season on hold, but we are determined that you will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with you,"" they said.

The machine is entering a second trial phase after three months of use on dozens of people, among whom about 20 had the virus and the others did not. Unlike the uncomfortable standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, it is not invasive and provides an immediate result.



""It's the same principle as a classic breathalyzer test,"" said Christian George, director of research at the National Centre of Scientific Research at la Croix-Rousse hospital.

""The machine will register the molecules in the exhaled air and then detects the traces of the sickness.""



Jean-Christophe Richard, head of intensive care at the hospital, said the objective was to have the machine fully operational by the end of the year.



""This type of quick test means we will have the results straightaway and can then move the patient to the right area of the hospital. As we now have a few efficient treatments, the quicker we can diagnose the quicker we can treat them,"" he said.

Bruno Lina, an independent virus expert who has been consulted on the machine, said it was a step in the right direction, but at this stage was too expensive for widespread distribution in hospitals.

25328,2020-07-23 8:23,"Concentration camp guard, 93, given suspended sentence in German case","A German court on Thursday convicted a 93-year-old former SS private of being an accessory to murder at the Stutthof concentration camp, where he served as a guard in the final months of the Second World War. He was given a two-year suspended sentence.

Bruno Dey was convicted of 5,232 counts of accessory to murder by the Hamburg state court, news agency DPA reported. That is equal to the number of people believed to have been killed at Stutthof during his service there in 1944 and 1945. He also was convicted of one count of accessory to attempted murder.

""How could you get used to the horror?"" presiding judge Anne Meier-Goering asked as she announced the verdict.

Because Dey was only 17, and later 18, at the time of his alleged crimes, his case was heard in juvenile court. Prosecutors had called for a three-year sentence, while the defence sought acquittal.

The trial opened in October. Because of Dey's age, court sessions were limited to two two-hour sessions a week. Additional precautions were taken to keep the case going during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

In a closing statement earlier this week, the wheelchair-bound German retiree apologized for his role in the Nazis' machinery of destruction, saying ""it must never be repeated.""

""Today, I want to apologize to all of the people who went through this hellish insanity,"" Dey told the court.

Several other investigations into Nazi-era crimes

For at least two decades, every trial of a former Nazi has been dubbed ""likely Germany's last."" But just last week, another ex-guard at Stutthof was charged, at age 95. A special prosecutors office that investigates Nazi-era crimes has more than a dozen ongoing investigations.

That's due in part to a precedent established in 2011 with the conviction of former U.S. autoworker John Demjanjuk as an accessory to murder on allegations that he served as a guard at the Sobibor death camp in German-occupied Poland.

Demjanjuk, an Ohio resident who steadfastly denied the allegations, died before his appeal could be heard.

LISTEN | Grandson of Holocaust survivor bears witness as former Nazi guard goes on trial:

In Germany, 93-year-old Bruno Dey is on trial for being an accessory to the murders of more than 5,000 people — because when he was 17, he was a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. 6:30

German courts had previously required prosecutors to justify charges by presenting evidence of a former guard's participation in a specific killing, often next to impossible given the circumstances of the crimes committed at Nazi death camps.

Prosecutors argued that as a Stutthof guard from August 1944 to April 1945, Dey aided all the killings that took place there during that period as a ""small wheel in the machinery of murder.""

Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Jerusalem, criticized the suspended sentence as ""tainting the process"" of trying to bring justice for Holocaust survivors, saying Dey waited until he was facing jail time before apologizing for his actions.

""We're very pleased he's convicted but upset about the sentence, which in a certain sense is an insult to the survivors,"" Zuroff said. ""There has to be some element of punishment.""

60,000 killed at camp in what is now Gdansk

Dey gave wide-ranging statements to investigators about his service, saying that he was deemed unfit for combat in the regular Germany army in 1944 so was drafted into an SS guard detachment and sent to the camp near Danzig, now the Polish city of Gdansk.

Initially a collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from Danzig, Stutthof from about 1940 was used as a so-called ""work education camp"" where forced labourers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens, were sent to serve sentences and often died.

Others incarcerated there included political prisoners, accused criminals, people suspected of homosexual activity and Jehovah's Witnesses.

From mid-1944, when Dey was posted there, tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos in the Baltics and from Auschwitz filled the camp, along with thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal Nazi suppression of the Warsaw uprising.

More than 60,000 people were killed there by being given lethal injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts, shot or starved. Others were forced outside in winter without clothing until they died of exposure or were put to death in a gas chamber.

Dey told the court that as a trained baker's apprentice, he attempted to get sent to an army kitchen or bakery when he learned he'd been assigned to Stutthof.

As a guard there, he said he was frequently directed to watch over prisoner labour crews working outside the camp.

Dey acknowledged hearing screams from the camp's gas chambers and watching as corpses were taken to be burned but he said he never fired his weapon, and once allowed a group to smuggle meat from a dead horse they'd discovered back into the camp.

What's happening in the rest of the world

The city of Tokyo announced a record 366 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday, exceeding 300 for the first time as Japan begins a four-day weekend with many people joining a tourism promotion campaign that the government is pushing despite concerns of a new wave of infections nationwide.

The number of daily cases in Tokyo had fallen to just a small number in late May after the government ended a national state of emergency but have climbed steadily since late June, with the number tripling in the first three weeks of July.

Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike has asked residents to stay home as much as possible during the long weekend, even though Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has gone ahead with a ""Go To"" tourism promotion campaign that excludes Tokyo for now to help the badly hit tourism industry.

Until recently, officials have said most cases were limited to younger people linked to nightlife entertainment districts, but experts at a Tokyo task force meeting on Wednesday said infections have spread to older people and to regular homes, workplaces and restaurants.

Tokyo, which earlier allocated 1,000 beds for coronavirus patients, has asked hospitals to secure up to 2,800 beds, but preparations are taking time and beds are filling up quickly. Koike said the city is also in the process of securing hotel rooms for less sick patients.

The city would have been hosting the Summer Olympics beginning Friday, but the global competition was scrapped for 2020 months ago. Hopes the Games can take place in 2021 are questionable.

New data by the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), released overnight, showed that just in the week to July 14 — the latest figures available — there was an excess of 5,022 deaths by natural causes, about half more than usual.

The council's data showed that of the 17,090 extra deaths, 11,175 were people over the age of 60, a telltale sign of COVID-19, which is overwhelmingly more deadly for older people.

Africa's most industrialized nation is in the middle of a runaway epidemic of the coronavirus, with cases increasing by more than 10,000 a day and the current total just shy of 400,000. But its recorded death toll has so far been low, at 5,940 deaths, or less than 1.5 per cent of cases.

Police in Bolivia said this week they recovered 420 bodies from various locations in La Paz and in Santa Cruz, in the span of five days. Between 80 and 90 per cent of them are believed to have had the virus.

Bolivia has reported nearly 2,300 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, although the real number is believed to be higher. Cesar Salinas, the president of the Bolivian soccer federation, was among the dead. Interim President Jeanine Anez tested positive and says she is recuperating in quarantine.

The interim Bolivian government says the peak of the outbreak is not expected until August, putting into a question whether a necessary election after a controversial vote last year can be held in early September, as planned.

""It's very flattering,"" said Nelson White, who has had to keep his accomplishment under wraps since its sale in February as the pandemic threw a few wrenches into the final Smithsonian paperwork.

""I've sort of been sitting on it, and the artwork has been sitting in my basement in a crate the last six months, knowing it was going to Washington, just waiting for those details.""

The details have since been ironed out, and White's portrait Veteran Elder is destined for its new American home, already en route in a wooden crate to Washington, D.C.

The oil painting depicts Ellsworth Oakley, a Mi'kmaw elder and American veteran of the Korean War — who joined up at the age of just 17 — saluting with a stoic gaze.

Oakley, originally from Massachusetts, now calls Eskasoni, N.S., home. White is friends with his daughter, and had crossed paths with him at powwows before inspiration struck.

""He just had a great face. His face just called out to be painted,"" White told CBC Radio's Newfoundland Morning.

""Once I knew his story, and knew that he served, he was just the perfect subject, both because of his look and because of his background and where he came from.""

Recognizing Indigenous veterans

White always felt Veteran Elder was a special work, and as he called around trying to find a special home for it, a gallery in North Carolina recommended he give the Smithsonian a ring.

""To my amazement, they knew who I was and were interested in the artwork. So I made a formal application to their acquisitions committee,"" said White.

The committee, he said, had their eye out for artwork from east coast Indigenous artists, as well as work involving Indigenous military experience. White — a member of the Flat Bay Band who lives in St. John's — and Veteran Elder fit the bill.

When you get a yes, and when you get a big yes, it's very exciting. - Nelson White

""I actually ticked a lot of boxes that they were looking for, at the time,"" said White.

White felt it was a particular honour for the piece to go to the National Museum of the American Indian.

""A lot of my work centres around Indigenous identity, and to be part of that collection is very symbolic for me. It recognizes my work and it also recognizes Elder Oakley and all those thousands and thousands of Indigenous people who served in the military,"" he said.

A career highlight

White has had wide-ranging success as an artist, from becoming The Rooms' first Indigenous artist-in-residence to taking part in numerous shows, such as the one last spring in St. John's where Veteran Elder was shown at Eastern Edge Gallery.

And while any career in the arts has its ups and downs, White said this sale stands out as a highlight.

""It's very flattering that an institution of that magnitude accepts my work, because sometimes as an artist, anyone out there who works in the arts understands rejection, understands you're going to get a lot of noes,"" he said.

""When you get a yes, and when you get a big yes, it's very exciting.""

The museum has two branches, in Washington and New York City, and White isn't sure where his painting will be shown or when, but said curators have said they will update him when it goes public.

25354,2020-07-23 7:29,Nick Cordero cabaret album set for September to honour late Canadian performer,"A live album recording of a cabaret show from late Canadian stage star Nick Cordero will hit shelves in September.

Broadway Records says it will release ""Nick Cordero: Live Your Life"" on Sept. 17 — what would have been his 42nd birthday.

Cordero, who grew up in Hamilton, died earlier this month after spending three months in a Los Angeles hospital with complications from COVID-19.

His upcoming posthumous album is named after one of his songs and captures his cabaret performance in April 2019 at the Broadway supper club Feinstein's/54 Below.

Cordero was in many stage productions, including ""Bullets Over Broadway"" in New York, which earned him a Tony Award nomination.

His wife, dancer and personal trainer Amanda Kloots, says she'd never seen Cordero work so hard on something as his cabaret show, and he was nervous to perform it.

""I was so proud of him and absolutely loved watching him onstage these two nights,"" she said Wednesday in a post on her Instagram account.

""He created this show from scratch, choosing songs to tell a story … his story.""

Broadway Records says Cordero and Emmy Award-winning producer Michael J. Moritz Jr. had planned to release the recording of his cabaret act but didn't get a chance to.

The label says the album will now be released with his family's blessing to honour his legacy.

Proceeds will go to benefit Kloots and their one-year-old son Elvis.

Guest performers on the album include Kathryn Gallagher, Drew Gehling, Sara Chase, and Zach Braff.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/cordero-1.5659935?cmp=rss,news,canada,hamilton
25312,2020-07-23 7:04,"Bolivia hospitals, funeral homes slammed by coronavirus","Police in Bolivia's major cities have recovered the bodies of hundreds of suspected victims of the coronavirus from homes, vehicles and, in some instances, the streets. Hospitals are full of COVID-19 patients and short of staff, keeping their gates closed and hanging out signs that say: ""There is no space.""

The Bolivian government says the peak of the outbreak is not expected until August.

Desperation is growing in one of Latin America's poorest countries, which seems overwhelmed by the virus even as it endures political turmoil stemming from a flawed election and the ouster of President Evo Morales last year. A plan to hold elections in September, seen as a key to stabilizing its democracy, is increasingly in doubt as the pandemic worsens.

Some funeral homes have hired more staff to cope with the influx of the dead, and hearses at the main cemetery in the capital of La Paz line up daily to deliver bodies. With little space available, the mayor's office only allows burials for people from the municipality and charges more than most Bolivians can afford for cremation.

""My brother died of pneumonia and we cannot find a funeral home. We have to wait until tomorrow. Many people are going through the same thing and nobody helps us,"" said Herminia Carpio, sobbing as she waited to collect her brother's body at the door of the largest public hospital in La Paz.

Some doctors are issuing falsified death certificates for virus victims, putting funeral home staff at risk, according to an undertaker in La Paz who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

A COVID-19 death in Bolivia requires strict safety protocols for handling the body, raising the price of funerals. There are allegations that some relatives have paid doctors to list a cause of death unrelated to the virus. In any case, medical services are overworked and may not have the time or capacity to assess the cause of death accurately.

September election in doubt

Shocking news came this week when police said they recovered 420 bodies from various locations in La Paz and in Bolivia's biggest city, Santa Cruz, in the span of five days. Between 80 and 90 per cent of them are believed to have had the virus.

""The pandemic has put the state's response capacity in crisis,"" said sociologist Renzo Abrezeze.

Like many other countries, the Andean nation instituted restrictions to curb the spread of the virus but gradually started to lift them June 1 to relieve the economic strain on the population of more than 11 million.

Bolivia has reported nearly 2,300 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, although the real number is believed to be higher. Cesar Salinas, the president of the Bolivian soccer federation, was among the dead. Interim President Jeanine Anez tested positive and says she is recuperating in quarantine.

A health-care worker takes samples from elderly residents to test for the coronavirus at the San Jose nursing home in Cochabamba, Bolivia last week. At least 60 residents at the senior care facility tested positive and 10 have died from related symptoms in the last two weeks, amid a rise in cases and fatalities in the Andean country. (Dico Solis/The Associated Press)

The political fallout from the pandemic is escalating. A committee that advises the health ministry on outbreak containment measures said in a letter this week to Bolivia's top election official that holding the vote as scheduled would not be advisable.

Most researchers agree that ""to plan activities such as an election, you must wait for the epidemiological curve of active cases to have a sustained decrease for a period of 14 days, so the date of Sept. 6 is not appropriate,"" the committee, made up mostly of doctors, wrote to Salvador Romero, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

The committee has previously said many people who contract the coronavirus do not report their illness for fear of being stigmatized. Many in rural areas do not believe in the existence of the virus, while disregard for physical distancing rules in the cities is making matters worse, according to the committee.

Six of the eight parties in Bolivia's election race have said they favour a postponement.

Demand for fake cure

Some Bolivians desperate to avoid or cure COVID-19 are ingesting chlorine dioxide, which the senate has approved as a treatment even as the country's health ministry says people should stay away from it.

Chlorine dioxide is a bleach-like substance that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned can jeopardize consumers' health and should not be purchased or drunk as a medical treatment.

But in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba — where the provincial government has approved its use — some shoppers said they believed the substance could help.

""I heard on the news that they were selling chlorine dioxide at the pharmacy. Acquaintances of mine took it, one for prevention and one for healing. It is doing them good,"" said Eric Ocanha, outside of a pharmacy.

Others said they were confused about the advice they had been given.

""As always, the authorities say: 'Consult your doctor.' Which doctor? The poor do not have a doctor,"" said Dionisio Flores.

Dr. Rene Sahonero, an adviser to the health ministry, said the ministry strongly warned against the use of chlorine dioxide for COVID-19.

""We have already drawn up a resolution that says this substance is not approved, that it is not suitable for human consumption and that it can have serious consequences,"" Sahonero said, adding that cases of chlorine dioxide poisoning had been reported.

Despite the ministry warning, the country's senate passed a bill last week approving the use of chlorine dioxide to prevent and treat the coronavirus. That must pass the lower chamber and survive a veto challenge before it becomes law.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/bolivia-coronavirus-outbreak-1.5659884?cmp=rss,news,world,

It's part of a movement to help community members become self-sufficient and harvest their own food, says Gzaagidwan Anishnaabe, a co-ordinator with the Lands and Resources department.

Anishnaabe says 50 turkeys are being released this summer to run wild and multiply, adding that they will be ready for hunting in a few years.

""Our ancestors, our grandparents survived in that area and that's a history this entire country is built on — is agriculture and everything else living with the land,"" Anishnaabe said.

""That's amazing to see.""

Anishnaabe said the turkeys will be used for more than food.

""You'd be able to utilize the entire bird like for its feathers,"" Anishnaabe said. ""Also to use in our traditional activities like traditional powwows and have a new dance started in our community. Having a mzise dance — a turkey dance.""

Anishnaabe says a growing number of people this year are also gardening to provide their own produce.

25311,2020-07-23 6:51,Portland's mayor tear gassed by federal agents,"The mayor of Portland, Ore., was tear gassed by federal agents late Wednesday as he stood at a fence guarding a federal courthouse during another night of protest against the presence of the agents, who were sent by President Donald Trump to quell unrest in the city.

Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, said it was the first time he'd been tear gassed and appeared slightly dazed and coughed as he put on a pair of goggles someone handed him and drank water. He didn't leave his spot at the front, however, and continued to take gas. Around Wheeler, the protest raged, with demonstrators lighting a large fire in the space between the fence and the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse amid the pop-pop-pop of federal agents deploying tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd.

It wasn't immediately clear if the federal agents knew Wheeler was in the crowd when they used the tear gas.

Earlier in the night, Wheeler was mostly jeered as he tried to rally demonstrators who have clashed nightly with federal agents but was briefly applauded when he shouted ""Black Lives Matter"" and pumped his fist in the air. The mayor has opposed federal agents' presence in Oregon's largest city, but he has faced harsh criticism from many sides and his presence wasn't welcomed by many, who yelled and swore at him.

WATCH | Trump, Barr unveil controversial police operation for some cities:

U.S President Donald Trump has announced his plans to send federal law enforcement agents to other American cities as protests continue, despite opposition from local officials. 2:00

""I want to thank the thousands of you who have come out to oppose the Trump administration's occupation of this city,"" Wheeler told hundreds of people gathered downtown near the federal courthouse. ""The reason this is important is it is not just happening in Portland … we're on the front line here in Portland.""

Some Portland residents, including city council members, have accused Wheeler of not reining in local police, who have used tear gas multiple times before federal agents arrived early this month in response to nearly two months of nightly protests since George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. Others, including business leaders, have condemned Wheeler for not bringing the situation under control before the agents showed up.

Protesters in the crowd held signs aloft that read ""Tear Gas Ted"" in reference to the Portland Police Bureau's use of the substance before federal agents arrived. When the mayor left the protest, around 12:40 a.m., some protesters surrounded him and shouted angrily at him as he walked away. One person shouted, ""You've got to be here every single night!""

While taking questions Wednesday night — and before he was tear gassed — Wheeler was criticized for the actions of his own police department, not defunding the local police and not having Portland police protect people from federal agents. The mayor said he wants to use the energy of the protests to make changes.

Wheeler then addressed the much larger crowd from a raised balcony, saying: ""I am here tonight to stand with you.""

Federal government faces lawsuits

Earlier Wednesday, the city council banned police from co-operating with federal agents or arresting reporters or legal observers. The presence of the agents has angered local residents, with a man hospitalized in serious condition nearly two weeks after getting struck by what appeared to be a rubber bullet fired by a federal officer in fatigues.

Wheeler's tense nighttime appearance downtown came hours after attorneys for Oregon urged a judge to issue a restraining order against agents deployed to quell the protests.

The arguments from the state and the U.S. government came in a lawsuit filed by Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who accuses federal agents of arresting protesters without probable cause, whisking them away in unmarked cars and using excessive force. Federal authorities have disputed those allegations.

The lawsuit is part of the growing pushback to Trump sending federal agents to Portland and announcing they would be going to Chicago and Albuquerque, N.M., to fight rising crime, a move that's deepening the country's political divide and potentially setting up a constitutional crisis months ahead of the presidential election. Democratic mayors of 15 cities condemned the use of federal officers in a letter to the U.S. attorney general.

Dozens of women in Portland have formed a nightly “wall of moms” between Black Lives Matter protesters and federal agents, dispatched by President Donald Trump.

The state acknowledged that federal agents have the right to defend the courthouse but argued that they had overstepped.

The lawsuit is one of several filed over authorities' response to the Portland protests. On Thursday, a judge will hear arguments in a legal challenge that the American Civil Liberties Union filed on behalf of journalists and legal observers who say they were targeted and attacked by Portland police while documenting demonstrations.

25346,2020-07-23 6:00,How the N.W.T. is reducing addictions harm during COVID-19,"The Tree of Peace Friendship Centre in Yellowknife counsels more than 200 people, but COVID-19 has isolated many of those clients from badly needed in-person services.

The centre's full reopening can't come soon enough, says community wellness manager Kathy Arden.

""When you're sitting with a client, you can read their body language and look in their eyes and see how they're actually feeling,"" she said.

""It's greatly affected many of them. Many relapsed and were struggling with the isolation. There was a lot of suicidal ideation going on.""

The centre has offered telephone counselling since April, after COVID-19 restrictions started coming into effect across the territory. Some clients prefer in-person counselling, and others simply don't have access to a phone.

On occasion, counsellors will meet with clients at a park near city hall or go to a restaurant to have a physically distanced coffee with them.

In January, Arden said 285 clients accessed counselling, back when they could drop in and see someone right away.

""Many have expressed during COVID-19 that they can't wait for the Tree of Peace to open because they can have that face-to-face contact with counsellors,"" Arden said.

In March, when COVID-19 restrictions came in, the friendship centre saw 118 people — less than half the usual number of clients. By April, that number was down to 76. It's back up to 111 clients as of May, but the initial shock of COVID-19 has left the organization scrambling.

Arden is preparing for a high demand for the Living in Balance programs, where clients can discuss things like banking, personality disorders, addiction and post traumatic stress disorder.

With COVID-19 restrictions, they can offer 10 spots. Typically, up to 17 people attended the sessions pre-pandemic.

""We're ready, we've got everything in place,"" she said. ""We're just waiting to have our inspection"" from the Workers' Safety and Compensation Commission.

Isolation biggest threat to wellness: doctor

During COVID-19, many of the supports like treatment, counselling and vocational training have evaporated and ""destabilized"" people, said Dr. Jennifer Harris, who leads the territory's opioid therapy treatment.

The friendship centre also connects people with residential treatment, but places like Poundmaker's Lodge, Aventa for women and Fresh Start Recovery Centre, all based in Alberta, are operating at a reduced capacity.

Then, there is the arrival of deadly opioids on N.W.T. streets.

Dr. Jennifer Harris says the greatest threat to people's wellness is isolation from services. (Kate Kyle/CBC)

In June alone, there were five suspected opioid overdoses in the territory. At least one of those overdoses was traced to carfentanil, which is 100 times stronger than fentanyl and considered one of the most toxic opioids.

Front-line workers like Harris say the greatest threat to wellness, still, is isolation from services.

Case managers are focusing on continuity of care. They send people from their appointments with multiple naloxone kits, which a client typically ends up using on someone they know.

The kits, which are used to reverse the effects of opioid overdoses, are available in all of the communities, health centres, community cabins and pharmacies across the territory.

A safe supply program gives a handful of high-risk individuals a supply of prescription opioids to complement suboxone and methadone treatments, which are often used to treat addictions.

Expanding safe supply without adequate oversight could be a risk, said Harris.

How prevention measures could help

Harris wants a territory-wide chronic pain management program to keep people off the path of opioid addiction, but there is a shortage of practitioners.

Opioid addiction represents a smaller percentage of substance use disorders in the N.W.T., she said. Its presence is most severe in the southern N.W.T. and in Yellowknife.

Criminalization of personal use of illicit drugs makes it harder for people to get the help they need, said Harris.

She looks to Portugal, which treats addiction ""more like a health problem versus a reason to incarcerate somebody when they found small amounts of drugs on them.""

Decriminalization in Portugal, for example, has helped lower overdoses, and contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C rates, she said.

This week, B.C. Premier John Horgan said he wants the federal government to decriminalize the possession of drugs for personal use , to address the stigma of illicit drug use.

Yellowknife North MLA Rylund Johnson said the criminalization of personal drug consumption makes it hard for police to find informants and build trust in the community.

RCMP in the N.W.T. have led major federal drug investigations that have been some of the largest criminal trials for southern gang members. They make efforts to overlook personal use, because without trust, police can't find informants to then pursue big traffickers.

MLA Rylund Johnson says decriminalization won't lower drug use, but it could allow the territory to put resources where they are needed. (Submitted)

""Users simply won't talk to the police because they're afraid, and so it's kept in the shadows,"" Johnson said.

He added that decriminalization will not lower drug use, but that it would allow the territory to put resources where they are needed.

""There is a lot of work that needs to be done to increase mental health and addictions support,"" he said.

""Yellowknife is fortunate that we have the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation, one of the best programs in the North, but we need 33 of those. We need one for every single community.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tree-of-peace-addictions-services-covid-1.5659196?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
25336,2020-07-23 6:00,Fatal police encounters in Manitoba jumped in last 2 years; most involved Indigenous people,"Manitoba has experienced two of its deadliest years on record when it comes to people being killed by police, and the majority of those who died were Indigenous.

A CBC analysis of the people killed in police encounters across Canada shows nine people in Manitoba have died after either being shot or Tasered by a police officer in the last two years, compared to six deaths in the six years prior.

Six of those who died over the last two years were Indigenous, one was black, and two have not been identified by police.

One of those who died was Eishia Hudson, 16, whose police shooting death in April 2020 was one of four in 40-day period in Winnipeg.

Her death sparked protests across the city and Canada's Indigenous Bar Association called for an independent inquiry into the shooting.

Her father, William Hudson, has become an advocate against what he deems unnecessary use of force.

""I lost my daughter. How many other parents out there have lost children to this? Change has to happen and it has to happen soon,"" Hudson said in an interview with CBC this week.

Eishia is the youngest person to die from a fatal police shooting in at least two decades in Manitoba, according to CBC's analysis.

'No justice in that'

Police allege the teen was the driver of a stolen SUV that crashed into several cars after being used in the robbery of a Liquor Mart on April 8.

When the SUV came to a stop at the intersection of Lagimodiere Boulevard and Fermor Avenue, officers approached the vehicle and Eishia was shot, police say.

The investigation into her death has been turned over to the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which investigates all fatal encounters involving police in the province.

William Hudson believes more could have been done before police fired.

""There were no houses around. There could have been a canine unit. Before the canine they could have used a spike strip. They could have used how many other procedures to make sure the outcome didn't come this way,"" he said.

Less than 12 hours after his daughter died, William Hudson's friend Jason Collins was also fatally shot by police.

""It was two people that were close… It's very tough, you know. It's why I want to keep the fight strong. We did the rally [at the Manitoba Legislature on June 19] … and immediately people are really asking me, 'When are we going to do the next one?'"" he said.

""We have to keep being heard. And that's the only way we have to get change to happen.""

Hudson says he want to help other families who lost a loved one in a lethal encounter with police.

""We're all kids once. We all made mistakes. I think police shouldn't have done what they done. I mean, it's a justice system,"" he said.

""That was taking my daughter's life. There was no justice in that.""

Inequality drives over-representation: lawyer

The latest CBC analysis, which comes at a time when use of force by police has been under intense scrutiny following the May killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, is an update of a 2018 investigation that looked at fatal encounters with police from 2000 to 2017.

Since 2000, 28 people have been killed in encounters with police in Manitoba. Of those, 17 were Indigenous and about one-third happened in the last two years.

Eighteen of those killed suffered from mental health problems or symptoms of drug abuse, according to CBC's database.

Zane Tessler, the civilian director of Manitoba's Independent Investigation Unit, says it is too early to point to a reason for the spike this year.

""Other than the fact that someone died as a result of that interaction, each of the circumstances are different than the next one,"" he said.

""You can go for months without having a police officer discharge their firearm and then suddenly, for who knows why, you have four officers discharging their weapons at four different people over four different days.""

Defence lawyer Zilla Jones says the death of George Floyd could spark change in how policing is viewed across Canada. (Darin Morash/CBC)

Winnipeg defence attorney Zilla Jones says she hopes the death of George Floyd will be the flashpoint needed to spark change in how police are funded, how police respond to calls, and when force should be used.

Jones says both Indigenous and Black people are over-represented in every aspect of the criminal justice system, so it makes sense they are more often involved in fatal encounters with police.

""Sentencing is disproportionate. Lack of parole is disproportionate. Amount of arrests is disproportionate. Poverty is disproportionate. So all of it connects,"" Jones said.

""People that are having more encounters with police that are being viewed a certain way by police are more likely to be killed by police. So it's not surprising or abnormal considering the other inequalities that we have in our society.""

Police cleared in 3 of 9 shootings

A spokesperson for the Winnipeg Police Service said they couldn't do an interview as the 2020 deaths are still being investigated.

After the shooting deaths of Eishia Hudson and Jason Collins, Chief Danny Smyth said the police force would fully co-operate with the IIU's investigation.

""This has been a tragic 12-hour period of time for our community,"" Smyth said on April 9. ""I can tell you that the police officers did not come into work expecting to be involved in shootings, especially those involving fatalities.""

In three of the nine police-related deaths that have occurred in the past two years, Manitoba's police watchdog has cleared officers of wrongdoing.

All four deaths from this year remain open and active investigations.

The investigation into the 2019 Taser death of a 42-year-old man is complete, but is with Manitoba Prosecutions Service awaiting a Crown opinion, Tessler said.

The investigation into the 2018 death of Matthew Fosseneuve, meanwhile, is at a standstill as the IIU awaits a court ruling on the status of cadets as witnesses.

The 34-year-old experienced a medical emergency when police used a Taser to subdue him. Manitoba's chief medical examiner has ruled the death accidental, with contributing factors — meth use and physiological stress from a fight and police restraint.

There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own.

The CBC's research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters.

The database focuses on fatal encounters where police used force. It does not include in-custody deaths, self-inflicted wounds as a result of suicide or attempts to evade police, or accidental police-caused deaths (such as a traffic accident).",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-police-deaths-analysis-2018-2020-1.5659207?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba

""The worst situation for patients is when they're about to be put on a ventilator and they're all by themselves,"" she said.

""So we would call patients' families on the phone, but having patients talk to their families on the phone is not the same as having them physically there or seeing them.""

Sandhanwalia says in some cases physicians were using their own devices to connect families virtually through apps like Facetime, since patients didn't always have access to a smartphone.

She's one of the doctors who helped launch Frontline Connect Canada. The initiative is the work of a group of Ontario physicians who put out a call online for donated smartphones and tablets to help patients and physicians to communicate with families during COVID-19. So far, they've donated more than 275 devices to four Ontario hospitals and 63 hospices and care facilities.

The not-for-profit's tech team supports the devices remotely and provides free troubleshooting. (Submitted/Frontline Connect Canada)

The donations have also helped health-care teams have critical conversations with families about goals of care, patient treatment plans and updates.

""It's immeasurable how helpful they've been. You see the happiness on patient's faces when they can see a loved one,"" Sandhanwalia said.

'A simple solution to address a really big need'

In Toronto, the University Health Network still doesn't allow friends and family members to visit patients, with exceptions for essential visitors. In other regions across the province, visitor guidelines are being updated but there are still some restrictions in place to protect patients and staff from COVID-19.

Emmy Luo, a recent University of Guelph graduate and one of the co-founders of Frontline Connect, says the group is looking for donations to get more devices into health-care facilities across the province.

""COVID isn't over and a lot of these infection control measures are going to continue, even as the rest of Ontario opens up,"" she said.

The physicians started a petition asking telecommunications providers and tablet manufacturers to help by donating encased tablets with calling and data capabilities. (Submitted/Frontline Connect Canada)

Luo said community support and a few initial donations from telecommunications companies helped get the not-for-profit off the ground.

""It's such a simple solution to address a really big need.""

Frontline Connect is accepting donations of working phones and tablets. Ontario hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities can request donated smartphones and tablets for free online. Each device will be delivered to the facility by a donor or a volunteer.

Sandhanwalia says the goal is to ensure no patients suffer alone.

25329,2020-07-23 5:00,Woman shamed for Florida licence plate asks Sudburians to 'be kind to people' amid COVID-19 anxiety,"Lynn Harper-Kutschke is pictured waiting at the border to enter Canada on her return from Florida in June. (Submitted by Lynn Harper-Kutschke)

A woman, born and raised in Sudbury, says she's shocked following several hostile encounters involving people in the community shaming her for the licence plate on her car.

After retiring about six years ago, Lynn Harper-Kutschke said she decided to split her time between Florida and Sudbury. The licence plate on her car is from Florida.

When Harper-Kutschke crossed the border at Sault St. Marie on June 4, she said she was unprepared for how unwelcome she would be made to feel.

""I'm really surprised that my fellow Canadians and fellow Sudburians are doing this to me,"" she said.

'Licensed and insured in Florida'

So far, the 59-year-old said she's been on the receiving end of everything from finger wagging, to people threatening to call the police, to some people hurling slurs at her through their car window — with her granddaughter in the passenger seat.

""The car is licensed and insured in Florida and because I couldn't fly home I had to bring my car ... so that's why I drove my car home,"" she said.

When Harper-Kutschke retired, she decided to spend about half the year in Florida. (Submitted by Lynn Harper-Kutschke)

She said typically she leaves the car in Florida when she returns to Sudbury, but because of COVID-19 she decided to drive home this time, not knowing how much attention she would receive.

It's just getting worse every day. — Lynn Harper-Kutschke

""Oh my goodness. It's daily,"" she said, ""To the point, where it's not anybody being nice about it.""

On one occasion, Harper-Kutschke said a man pulled up near her car, rolled down the window and began swearing at her, while her granddaughter was in the car.

'It's because of Grandma's plate'

""He sticks his finger out and gives my granddaughter and I the finger,"" she said.

""So I get up to the red light, we're right beside each other, he looks at me and he's telling me, 'F-off American ... and I just looked at my granddaughter and said, 'Just ignore him. It's because of Grandma's plate.""

The ugly encounters aren't limited to the road, Harper-Kutschke said, she's been confronted by people at the grocery store, in her neighbourhood and even on the way to medical appointments.

""It's just getting worse every day,"" she said.

Harper-Kutschke says she's being harassed daily because of her Florida licence plates. (Submitted by Lynn Harper-Kutschke)

'I'm allowed to come back'

""People just don't understand that I'm a Canadian and I'm allowed to come back here with my car.""

Since her arrival to Ontario, Harper-Kutschke said she's been tested for COVID-19 twice and both have returned negative.

She also said she underwent the mandatory 14-day quarantine period set out by the Canadian government for those returning from out-of-country.

""I got phone calls every day from border security or public health. Every day. At least two or three calls.""

So far, Harper-Kutschke hasn't reported the incidents of harassment to police.

""I just thought, 'Is that just adding more fuel to the fire?""

Harper-Kutschke said she wants Sudburians to be more understanding of people who may be driving with licence plates outside the province.

""I didn't sneak over, I'm a Sudburian, I'm a Canadian driving an American car,"" she said.

25331,2020-07-23 5:00,"Ontario nurse under investigation after anti-vax, COVID conspiracy social media posts","An Ontario nurse who works as a provincial long-term care home inspector is under investigation after she used social media to spread health misinformation, including the myth vaccines cause autism and claims the coronavirus pandemic is a conspiracy whose threat to public health has been exaggerated.

""Mandating masks is irresponsible, negligent, and dangerous,"" Kristal Pitter wrote in a Facebook post earlier this week, linking to a YouTube video that purports to detail the ""health risks"" of masks.

Pitter is a nurse practitioner in good standing with the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO). There is no evidence she has ever harmed or imposed her personal beliefs on a patient.

Most recently, Pitter has been working as a provincial long-term care home inspector since September 2018, according to CNO records and her LinkedIn profile.

She is under investigation by her employer as of this week because of her social media posts, CBC News has learned.

Social media posts raise concerns

A July 12 social media post from Kristal Pitter's account that propogates the myth that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned by a cabal of global elites in an effort to control the world. (Kristal Pitter/Facebook )

Pitter clearly identifies herself as a nurse practitioner on the same Facebook account she uses to spread false health information.

Pitter rails against vaccines and public health measures taken against COVID-19 on social media, claiming the pandemic is an attempt by a cabal of global elites to control the world.

""Knew this from the beginning. Numbers were grossly inaccurate,"" Pitter wrote about an article that claims official coronavirus deaths are exaggerated.

The controversy raises a number of questions about the public boundaries between personal and professional life and the thorny issue of whether one's personal beliefs have any sway on their ability to fulfil their professional obligations.

Leading advocates in the field of nursing and elder care have expressed concern that someone in a regulated medical profession, such as nursing, who speaks as an authority on health would be promoting fringe theories on social media that aren't rooted in science.

""I was alarmed by thinking that a colleague that is a nurse would propagate such misinformation and not use evidence,"" said Doris Grinspun, the CEO of the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario.

""I understand about freedom of expression, of course I do, but to promote and propagate misinformation about COVID and other things?""

""It concerns me hugely.""

CBC News made multiple attempts to reach Pitter for her side of the story, but she declined to comment. She then contacted Tillsonburg OPP.

Police told a CBC News reporter he would be charged with harassment if Pitter, who is a public official, was contacted again in regards to this story.

Leading voices in nursing, eldercare express concern

Grinspun said even though Pitter is working in more of an administrative role than a clinical one, the fact she's made her views known on a platform as public as Facebook raises questions.

""I'm just surprised that the ministry, unless they're completely unaware, has an individual working for them who doesn't follow basic evidence at this point.""

Some of Pitter's posts on Facebook have been flagged as ""false information"" by the social networking site, including one post that states tech billionaire Bill Gates plans to use a COVID-19 vaccine to permanently alter people's DNA.

She describes herself on her LinkedIn profile as ""mature, responsible, competent and compassionate individual who desires to have a positive impact on the world.""

Inspectors crucial in a system battered by scandal, deaths

As a healthcare sector, long-term care has been battered by a number of recent scandals, emerging from the long shadow of the inquiry into serial killer Elizabeth Wettlaufer's actions less than a year ago only to have the coronavirus pandemic erupt in March.

Since then, the illness has spread like wildfire through the system causing thousands of frail and elderly people to become seriously ill or die from COVID-19 at a rate in Canada that's twice that of other OECD countries.

The virus has also laid bare what our seniors sometimes have to endure after a recent military report called conditions ""horrific"" inside some facilities.

Laura Tamblyn Watts is the CEO of CanAge, Canada's National Seniors' Advocacy Organization. (Laura Tamblyn Watts/CanAge)

Laura Tamblyn Watts, a lawyer and the CEO of Canage, Canada's national advocacy centre for seniors, said having provincial inspectors who believe in evidence-based science is crucial in reviving an underfunded, understaffed and largely broken system.

""We're really relying on the professionalism and standards of those individual inspectors,"" she said.

""I think it's deeply concerning whenever we're seeing healthcare professionals providing information which is not evidence-based.""

According to officials with the Ministry of Long-Term Care, one of the primary responsibilities of a long-term care home inspector is to ""monitor, evaluate and promote the health, safety, quality of care and rights of residents in long-term care homes by consistently applying the established methodology and principles.""

Tamblyn Watts said all staff need to be in lockstep with the latest science and the official doctrine of infection control during the pandemic.

""If you have somebody who's in a position of power and authority who is wearing their medical hat, or in this case, an inspector's hat, but is publicly saying opposite information to what medical evidence is, we're in a real difficult situation.""

She said accurate information about vaccinations in particular is especially important as countries race to develop a viable inoculation against the coronavirus pathogen.

""Never before has it been more important that we have the right information about the effectiveness of vaccines than right now in the time of COVID-19.""

Health misinformation on the rise during pandemic

Since the global rush for a vaccine began, there has been a renewed push of online health misinformation on social media propagating myths that vaccines are ineffective or harmful or casting doubt on bonafide evidence-based information on COVID-19 through innuendo and rumour.

The increasing amount of false online information over the last decade is why a number of Canadian health agencies, including the Canadian Nurses Association and the College of Nurses of Ontario, have put out position papers on expectations around social media use and ethics guidelines to potentially prevent a single health professional from using their authority to promote fringe theories or misinformation that could tarnish their organization, profession or even potentially damage public health.

""As health-care professionals and leaders, we must be sensitive to the inherent power differentials between care providers and persons receiving care; and as trusted members of the public we need to be cognisant of our unique position to share information,"" Canadian Nurses Association president Tim Guest wrote in an email to CBC News.

""In an age where information is freely available but not necessarily reliable or accurate, it is an ethical obligation for healthcare professionals to disseminate evidence-based information. This responsibility must be taken seriously, particularly in a time of great uncertainty such as a pandemic.""

When asked about Pitter's social media activity, the province's nursing regulator wouldn't comment, citing privacy reasons.

""We cannot comment about a specific nurse,"" spokeswoman Angela Smith said, noting the CNO's role is to protect the public by addressing complaints about nursing care and a nurse's professional practice.

The Ontario government told CBC News it was unable to comment. ""We cannot speak to individual employee matters,"" the email said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/ontario-nurse-covid-19-conspiracy-social-media-1.5659338?cmp=rss,news,canada,london
25429,2020-07-23 4:00,Canada's quartet of Rio champions continue prep for 2021 ahead of uncertain Games,"Here we go again.

The Tokyo Olympics are one year away … we think.

But so much has changed since the world was last in this position. A global pandemic and social upheaval have conspired to create ubiquitous uncertainty. The rules are different. People are questioning what the Olympics are, or should be, all about.

The great, planetary, gathering and its value to humanity is most definitely being re-evaluated.

Are the Olympics worth the risk?

The costs to Japanese taxpayers are soaring. There is talk of downsizing the Games, staging a simplified event, and in the absence of a vaccine for COVID-19, further postponements or even outright cancellations appear to be on the table. Public sentiment and support in Japan, once almost unanimous, is now wavering.

WATCH | CBC Sports' Andi Petrillo hosts panel to discuss uncertain Tokyo Games:

CBC Sports' Andi Petrillo hosts a panel with guests Aaron Brown, Mandy Bujold, Catharine Pendrel, Sean McColl and Ben Titley to discuss life in quarantine, the new lead up to the Olympics, and Rule 50. 24:41

What about the athletes?

They are, after all, the major stakeholders in all of this.

Olympians are rare, a tiny fraction of the world's total population of several billion souls. Olympic champions are rarer still, only 8,782 in the history of the summer Games which began in 1896. Canada had only four gold medallists at the last summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

Trampoline gymnast Rosie MacLennan, swimmer Penny Oleksiak, high jumper Derek Drouin, and wrestler Erica Wiebe are all aiming to be in Tokyo next summer as the Games open on July 23rd at the lavish National Stadium.

That said all of these champions have been forced to accept a different reality which requires them to adjust expectations, confront fears, consider the possibility of Games without spectators, and listen to increased calls for them to be socially responsible while freely voicing their opinions.

We contacted each of these champions and asked them the same questions about what the year ahead might entail. They all answered promptly and with insight.

Their responses reflect the understanding that they are much more than players and celebrities but instead fully aware of their status as role models, contributors to the international discourse, and even inspirational performers.

Oleksiak comes off teenage dream at Rio

Penny Oleksiak was a 16-year-old phenomenon in the swimming pool at Rio. She won four medals, and burst spectacularly into the spotlight. It was almost as if she caught all of us, even herself, by surprise.

""The biggest change in me is how I view life,"" she wrote in an email. ""Now I try to live more fearlessly and wholeheartedly and I try my best to make everyone around me feel more loved and included with everything I do, day to day.""

WATCH | Penny Oleksiak reflects on Olympic debut:

Toronto's Penny Oleksiak claimed 4 swimming medals at Rio 2016 when she was 16-years-old. 6:08

But she has trepidation.

""My biggest concern or fear is just the Olympics and whether they will happen officially in 2021. The uncertainty is scary, but every single day my sights are set on the Olympics happening and all I can do is train as if they will.""

And if they do happen Oleksiak is ready to play her part, knowing that Canadians expect her to represent them well both on and off the field of play.

""I use my platform to express how I feel about certain social issues,"" she said. ""I think it's important for athletes and people in general, whether they have big followings or not, to make it known that they support certain social issues and causes and to let others know that they are being heard and supported.""

Drouin battles injuries en route to Tokyo

Derek Drouin will attempt to qualify for his third Olympics in Tokyo. He won high jump bronze in London in 2012, became world champion in 2015, and then soared to the Olympic title in Brazil in 2016.

Injuries have plagued him ever since.

""My biggest concern is that my body isn't capable of doing the same things it could do four and eight years ago,"" he admitted.

""With competitions being cancelled this season I haven't had the opportunity to test myself against my competitors in a really long time. You never really know how you're going to react in a competitive situation until you get there so it's a bit scary knowing I haven't tested myself like that in so long.""

WATCH | Derek Drouin captures high jump gold at Rio 2016:

Drouin worries that an Olympic Games without spectators on hand would alter performance levels.

""I thrive in a situation where there are fans to add a bit of pressure,"" he said. ""So I think in 99 per cent of scenarios, if there are no spectators, I would struggle to find the right level of adrenaline to compete. The one percent exception to that rule, I'd like to think, is the Olympic Games.""

On the matter of accepting social responsibility, Drouin sees it as a duty but one which manifests itself in a very personal way.

""We have amazing, outspoken, advocates in the athletic world who lead with their voices and we have athletes who lead by example. I like to consider myself to be the latter. This season hasn't been easy for any athlete and this year hasn't been easy for any human being. What I've tried to do is take on adversity by rolling with the punches and to exhibit an ability to re-evaluate and adapt to whatever life throws my way.""

MacLennan goes for trampoline 3-peat

Rosie MacLennan is the first Canadian athlete to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal at the summer Games. She won trampoline gold in London in 2012 and four years later in Rio de Janeiro where she carried the Canadian flag in the Opening Ceremony.

MacLennan is the vice-chair of the Canadian Olympic Committee's Athletes' Commission and holds a Master's degree in Exercise Science from the University of Toronto with a focus on athletes' rights, roles and responsibilities.

Her view on the future of the Tokyo Olympics extends well beyond her own personal goals and aspirations.

""I think my concerns and fears are pretty aligned with what most peoples' are and they aren't necessarily specific to the Games,"" she reckoned.

""They are more focused on the health and well-being of my family, our country, and the world. It is a generational experience that we are living through right now and with that comes a fair bit of uncertainty and so much is beyond our control. We aren't wired to manage uncertainty that well. With that in mind, I try to turn my attention to what I can control rather than fearing what I cannot.""

2-time Olympic trampoline champion Rosie MacLennan was Canada's flag bearer for the opening ceremonies. 3:12

And while she trains and readies herself as if the Tokyo Olympics will happen, MacLennan remains convinced of one thing. She subscribes to the reality that athletes like her must strive to use their voices for good.

""I think it stems from being human and genuinely caring about what is happening with the health crisis and racial injustice,"" she stressed.

""As an Olympic champion, maybe I have a different opportunity or platform from which to be heard than some others but the pressure and responsibility is more about doing what is right. I am really grateful for the opportunity to learn from other athletes and there are so many that are vocal, so many that are working towards change, and working to set a strong example.""

Wiebe driven by performance anxiety

The ancient sport of wrestling is where Erica Wiebe has made her mark as a champion. Into her thirties, she has matured both personally and professionally as an athlete.

""I know when I walked off the mat in Rio that I was scratching the surface of what I was capable of,"" she recalled.

""Now four years later it's amazing how much the aperture of my wrestling knowledge has expanded. I'm getting stronger, and fitter, and more dangerous, with each year. It's exciting.""

But though she is convinced of her growth, she harbours lingering doubt.

""My fear never really changes. Will I be enough? Will I be ready? Do I have what it takes to do it … again? This situation has made me have to face those fears even more so than in the past and find new ways to build the resilience and confidence to overcome them. The fears push me to be better every single day.""

Olympic wrestling champion Erica Wiebe had to focus on clinching a spot for Tokyo 2020 while the rest of the sporting world shut down due to COVID-19. 7:24

And Wiebe also understands that grappling with difficult, societal, issues comes with the territory of being an Olympian.

""Sport has always been a contested terrain for social and political statements,"" she concluded.

""We are seeing a rise in the power of the individual athlete and it'll be interesting to see where the balance of power will rest in a year's time. I will always hold up sport as one of the most powerful vehicles for social change and I'm proud to represent Canada and all that we stand for.""

They are four, distinct, Olympic champions.

In the history of the summer Games there have been 64 gold medals won by Canadian athletes beginning with George Orton's steeplechase triumph in Paris at the turn of the twentieth century.

We are at exactly the same stage we were 365 days ago.

For more than four decades, Smith has been travelling the globe in pursuit of softball glory, first as a player and now as a coach. After these Olympics, he's retiring.

""I'm coaching a wonderful group of women that I could not be prouder of. And if we can get to the Olympics when this pandemic subsides, I can't think of a better way to close a career,"" Smith said.

This summer was meant to be the ultimate final journey for Smith — a trip to Tokyo, leading this country's softball team into the Games.

""Each morning that I wake up I think about where we would be if the season were actually happening,"" Smith said from his backyard just outside Halifax.

""So for example, today we would be finishing up our pre-Olympic preparation and tomorrow we'd be taking the bus down to the Olympic village.""

Smith had every day mapped out. And then in early March when the pandemic hit in full force, all of his planning was thrown into disarray.

""On March 2 when we did our fitness testing and we had 89 personal bests, we had to be the fittest softball team in the world, bar none. We were building toward winning a gold medal which is what we believe we're going to do a year from now. All systems were go,"" Smith said.

The system has been shut down. Not just for the 20 women who were embarking on a journey years in the making – softball hasn't been part of the Olympics since 2008 – but for thousands of athletes around the world.

It's the universal struggle for high-performers who are wired to go faster and be stronger – now, maybe for the first time in their athletic careers, they must learn how to be still.

Smith told his softball team to take the summer off, an almost unfathomable consideration in preparation for the Olympics. He sees it as hitting the reset button.

""It took a little while for us to get our heads around it and to give ourselves permission to grieve and go through the rollercoaster of emotions you feel when you've worked so hard for something and then, through no fault of your own, it's been taken from you,"" Smith said.

But Smith, his team, and so many other Canadian athletes aren't about to sit around and feel sorry for themselves for too long.

The Games, as of now, are still going ahead starting in July 2021. It's one-year to go, again.

The softball team plans to come together in September to ramp up training.

For those athletes who have already qualified, which according to the International Olympic Committee is about half of the participants, and those who haven't, there are still so many unknowns.

Having a specific target is crucial to peaking at exactly the right time — medal performances on the grandest of athletic stages are surely centered around skill and preparation, but also timing.

""When you're preparing for the Olympics, the week out of the Olympics you want to be the fittest you've ever been in your life,"" rower Jenny Casson said from Victoria, B.C.

""And on an Olympic day you want to be the fittest you're ever going to be in your life and that's what we were tailoring our bodies for.""

Resilient rowers grow in confidence

If Smith is in the last chapter of his career, Casson's story is just beginning. She's part of a rowing pairs team alongside Jill Moffatt — a duo that just missed qualifying their spot for Tokyo last year.

Their final hope to make it to the Games hinged on one last-chance qualifier they were feeling massively confident for when everything stopped at the beginning of March.

""I started seeing the writing on the wall and it kind of felt like a weird dream. It happened so quickly,"" Moffatt said.

""I don't really want to sit around and cry about it. I want to move on as quickly as I can and get ready for the next year, but it definitely was hard at first to switch that mindset.""

Rowing teammates Jill Moffatt, left, and Jenny Casson have battled through a vast set of safety protocols in order to return to training on water. (Merijn Soeters/Rowing Canada Aviron)

The two are finally back on the water again, having to endure a rigorous set of protocols just to get their boat on the water at their training facility in Victoria — they have set times they're allowed to train, they have to sanitize all their equipment (including their boat) and are wearing Team Canada branded masks while doing it.

""At first, when we first heard all the protocols I was like, 'oh my gosh, how are we going to do this?'"" Moffatt said.

""It was a lot easier than anyone thought, and everyone said if we have to do this to get in the water it's well worth it. And our boats are cleaner than they've ever been,"" Casson added.

The two are upbeat and saying all the right things, for now. They're leaning on each other more than ever to stay motivated and focused. Their tolerance for flexibility and adaptability is being tested like never before.

Jill Moffatt, left, and Jenny Casson are working toward a final Tokyo Olympic qualifier in May 2021. (Merijn Soeters/Rowing Canada Aviron)

""Jill is the uplifting positive force, I think. She has this really good saying when we get down, 'what would your competition want you to be doing?' That's the biggest wake up call you can get, because I know my competition would be thrilled if we were moping around,"" Casson said.

As it stands right now, the two will get their final chance to qualify for the Olympics next May.

If there's fear for athletes about how their bodies will respond having been away from the track, off the pitch, or out of the pool for months, at least one Canadian athlete has done this all before and isn't too worried about it.

Hayden's experienced long layoffs before

At 36 years old, swimmer Brent Hayden has come out of retirement to make one last push for Olympic glory. He won bronze in the 100-metre Freestyle at the London Games in 2012, stepped away from his sport for seven years, only to decide to return for Tokyo last fall.

He never imagined having an extra year to prepare when he made the decision.

""I don't think anybody saw this coming. I was giving myself a year to get ready for Tokyo, which I already knew wasn't going to be a lot of time,"" Hayden said from Vancouver.

Hayden had to first earn his spot on the Canadian squad at the trials that were set for April. He was pleasantly surprised at how well his body was performing, having been away from swimming for so long. Age and experience are perhaps allowing him to train smarter and make him faster.

""I was on pace to not only make the team but I think I was on pace to do really well at the Games,"" Hayden said. ""I was working out a lot in the gym and I'd put on a lot of muscle mass. I had gotten a lot stronger. I think I could actually break my 50-metre Freestyle Canadian record.""

WATCH | Brent Hayden is staging a comeback, and training in his parents' backyard:

CBC Sports' Scott Russell spoke with swimmer Brent Hayden, who is training for next year's Olympics after retiring from the sport in 2012. 3:03

Perhaps that's what Hayden most wants to share with his fellow Canadian athletes right now: not to panic over lost time. He's done this all before. Instead of months away from training at the highest level, Hayden was away from it all for years.

He says the body is more resilient than anyone could imagine.

""The fact that my body was able to respond to my training not just from the time off but also at this age, a lot of positives out of that,"" he said.

When Hayden left swimming in 2012, he fell out of love with the sport. He was spiraling, depressed and never thought he'd find a way back.

Now he's here, with an entirely different outlook — one that could lead to a podium performance nine years after stepping off of one in London.

""There's a pandemic going on and that just makes you realize that there's more important things in life than sports,"" he said. ""Deep in my heart this was something that I really wanted to do and I believe anything is possible.""

Hinda Hassan, an ICU nurse at Grand River Hospital in Kitchener, Ont., said it happened to her during a scheduled massage therapy and chiropractic appointment last week.

She was given a COVID-19 screening questionnaire at a Waterloo, Ont., clinic that asked if she had come into contact with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus.

Hassan checked yes and clarified that this contact was due to her job at the hospital, where she's required to wear personal protective equipment.

She said she was told to come back after being tested for COVID-19.

The Ontario Ministry of Health released a COVID-19 patient screening guidance document in June to ensure that ""all health providers are following the same screening protocol"" and to ""help ensure consistency when dealing with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.""

A ministry spokesperson said in a statement that the document is only for risk assessment and that it's up to individual regulatory colleges to decide how to proceed if a patient screens positive.

Anyone who feels they have been denied service unfairly should take it up with their relevant regulatory college, the spokesperson said.

Hassan said there is no practical way for her to take time off work while she awaits a result. And, she said, it was tough news to hear given that she has put her own health and safety on the line during the pandemic.

""If you need my service, I can't say, 'Hey, you're high risk. I'm sorry. I can't take care of you.' But then here you are — you're denying me those rights,"" she said. ""It felt a little frustrating.""

Clinic apologized for denying service

The College of Massage Therapists of Ontario said someone like Hassan shouldn't have had problems, based on the province's current screening guidelines.

""An ICU nurse who works with COVID-19 patients (wearing appropriate personal protective equipment) should absolutely be able to receive massage therapy treatment, assuming they are not showing symptoms of COVID-19,"" a spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the College of Chiropractors of Ontario declined to comment on individual situations but said its professionals follow Ministry of Health screening guidelines.

The clinic has since called Hassan back, apologized and updated its policies. She said she's happy it made the change, and she plans to make another appointment.

Vicky MacLean, a fellow ICU nurse in Waterloo Region, in southern Ontario, said a similar situation happened in her family.

At the beginning of June, MacLean said, she tried to book a speech therapy appointment for her toddler but was screened out because of her contact with COVID-19 patients.

MacLean said she was offered a virtual appointment, but she felt her two-year-old wouldn't be able to focus during an online session.

After reaching out again last week, MacLean learned that the clinic had updated its screening policies based on provincial guidance, and she booked an in-person appointment.

She said she was ""overwhelmed with joy"" at the news but wishes she had managed to get an appointment sooner.

""We're doing everything we can at home, but ... she would be much further along if she'd had speech therapy,"" MacLean said of her daughter.

Vicki McKenna, president of the Ontario Nurses' Association, said she hasn't heard of similar problems from other nurses. But she said she's sorry to hear that such incidents are happening.

""Nurses, they've been under incredible stress over the last number of weeks, as many people have,"" she said. ""They deserve services as well — and certainly their families.""

'I don't see why my wife is punished'

It isn't just nurses who've been denied service, said Bob Heans, of Fergus, Ont.

He's a long-haul truck driver and often drives through the United States.

Heans said his wife recently made an appointment for a dental checkup, but when she mentioned his work as a long-haul driver, she was told she had to isolate from him for 14 days before she could be treated.

Heans said he doesn't think that was fair to either of them.

""Being a truck driver, we're probably all scared senseless for our family enough,"" he said.

""I probably wash my hands 100 times a day, probably go through two bottles of hand sanitizer in like two or three days,"" he said.

""I don't see why my wife has to be punished for this because I'm a long-haul truck driver.""

Stephen Laskowski, head of the Ontario Trucking Association, said the industry has worked hard to protect drivers from COVID-19 and doesn't think they're at an elevated risk because they travel south of the border.

""Long-haul truck drivers spend a lot of their time alone inside their trucks. Trucks are sterilized before drivers get in, when they come out,"" he said.

""We're very proud as an industry of how proactive we've been.""

Laskowski said he's heard other reports of drivers being turned away from health-care services, and that's a concern because they need to have periodic medical exams to renew their licences.

The association is currently trying to find out how widespread the issue is, he said.

Dental college seeking clarity

Heans's situation demonstrates a ""long-standing issue"" with current provincial screening guidance, said Kevin Marsh, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario.

Marsh said dentists — like massage therapists and other health-care providers — also use the province's screening template, which includes a question about whether a patient has travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days.

""Long-haul truck drivers who travel into the U.S.A. will always screen positive to this question. So will many pilots,"" Marsh said in an email.

""As a result, their family members will always come into question, as they have close contact with someone who screens positive.""

The dental college has asked the provincial government for more clarity regarding people in these categories, but it has not yet received a response, Marsh said.

Skipping the dentist

For now, Marsh said dentists can provide emergency dental care to patients who screen positive for COVID-19, but for non-essential appointments, patients still have to either get tested or isolate for 14 days.

Heans said that means he and his wife will simply skip the dentist for the foreseeable future.

""I guess we have to,"" he said.

As for Hassan, she said she's happy with how her situation was resolved but hopes it will shed light on a situation that other essential workers may be going through. Essential workers who find themselves in a situation like hers shouldn't be afraid to push back, she said.

""I think just have a discussion around it,"" Hassan said.

""In some cases, it's going to take some navigation, and that's how a decision is going to be made.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/essential-workers-denied-health-care-covid-1.5658341?cmp=rss,news,canada,kitchener-waterloo
25300,2020-07-23 4:00,Hundreds of thousands of Canadians could get a tax break for working from home during pandemic,"Hundreds of thousands of Canadians could be eligible for a lucrative tax deduction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But just how many get to claim that deduction could depend on their employers, and on how the Canada Revenue Agency deals with a series of questions raised by the sudden changes that have compelled millions of Canadians to work from home.

Armando Minicucci, a partner with the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said he expects a big increase in the number of Canadians able to claim a deduction for turning part of their home into an office.

""I would say the number would have to be in the hundreds of thousands,"" he said.

It's called the ""work-space-in-the-home"" deduction and you can claim it if you work from home more than 50 per cent of the time, or if you have a separate home office and use it to meet clients.

Either way, your employer has to certify that working from home is a condition of your employment. According to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), 174,210 Canadians took advantage of the deduction on their 2018 tax returns, claiming an average per person of $1,561.

The deduction allows those who qualify for it to reduce their tax bills by claiming a portion of their household expenses — such as utilities, cleaning and rent.

Normally, the number of people who can claim the deduction is limited. To qualify, you either have to spend more than 50 per cent of your time working from home, or you have to use a home office exclusively for work and regularly meet clients there.

How the pandemic changed things

The current rules require anyone claiming the deduction to get their employer to fill out a form — T2200 — certifying that working from home is a condition of employment. Without that form, the claim would be rejected, said the CRA.

But that was before the pandemic hit.

In March, as COVID-19 began to spread in Canada, public health authorities urged Canadians to stay home. Governments issued orders closing non-essential businesses and employers across the country began telling employees who could do their jobs remotely to work from home.

By mid-April, 3.3 million Canadians had moved out of their regular workplaces and were working from home, according to Statistics Canada's June Labour Force Survey. While that number dropped by 400,000 in June, millions of Canadians are still working from home.

Some employers, like Ottawa-based Shopify, have told employees they can work from home indefinitely.

By September, those sent home to work in March will have worked at least half the year at home — potentially putting them in a position to qualify for the deduction.

""We're getting further and further along in this pandemic where a lot of employees are going to have exceeded the six-month mark, and in that situation they should qualify,"" said Minicucci.

""But for those employees that have not worked the full six months or more at home, there's a question with respect to whether or not they meet the eligibility criteria.""

Whether those who haven't worked a full six months from home will be allowed to claim the deduction is one of the questions Canada's tax experts have asked the CRA to clarify, said Minicucci.

Keep those receipts

Even if some of those working from home end up falling short of the six-month benchmark, they can still deduct the cost of many of the supplies they have had to consume to get the job done, he said.

""You're looking at things like pens, paper, ink cartridges for your printer at home,"" he said. ""Those are items that are consumed. Capital items, unfortunately, are not deductible. So if you buy a printer, not deductible. If you buy a laptop, not deductible. Those are capital items.

""But if you buy items that are being consumed during the course of performing your employment duties, they are deductible. The 50 per cent criteria is not a condition in order to claim expenses for items that you consumed while performing your duties at home.""

Minicucci said now is a good time to talk with your employer about updating your employment contract, and to keep track of your receipts.

The pandemic has raised a number of questions that Canada's tax experts have asked the CRA to clarify, he added.

For example, will the CRA require each person to have a formal employment contract? Given the stay at home orders, should meeting clients through videoconference or teleconference platforms from home count as ""meeting clients at home""? Should the CRA relax the rule that says you can't claim internet as a work-from-home expense because it's considered a fixed cost?

A lot of paperwork for employers

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) also anticipates an increase in the number of Canadians claiming the home workspace deduction for the first time, and is also calling for the CRA to clarify several questions.

For example — should the CRA still require employers to fill out a T2200 form for every employee they asked to work at home?

""Employers will now be required to complete a great number of T2200s,"" CPA Canada said in a background paper. ""This will add a significant administrative burden for employers. To alleviate the burden, consideration should be given to using an alternative method to simplify the process for the pandemic.""

CPA Canada said it would like the CRA to clarify whether the ""more than 50 per cent of the time"" benchmark is calculated for the tax year, or for the period the employee was required to work from home. It also said the CRA should consider simplifying the process by allowing taxpayers to claim a per diem deduction for costs related to working from home.

No rule changes planned, says Finance

However, officials from the CRA and the Finance Department told CBC News there are no plans currently to change the rules on the home workspace deduction.

Conservative revenue critic Marty Morantz is calling on the government to clarify its plans for the deduction, and has put questions about the deduction on the House of Commons' order paper. He said those who have been working from home should be allowed to claim the deduction.

""I think it would be very reasonable for the government to say to folks who were doing their best to comply during the crisis by working at home, and incurring expenses, that they should have the opportunity to claim the deduction,"" he said.

Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, agreed.

""The deduction exists for a reason — to defray work-related costs that just happen to be home-related and if that reason now applies to a broader class of people, they should be able to make use of it,"" he said.

25296,2020-07-23 3:04,China launches ambitious attempt to land rover on Mars,"China launched its most ambitious Mars mission yet on Thursday in a bold attempt to join the United States in successfully landing a spacecraft on the red planet.

Tianwen-1 was launched on a Long March-5 carrier rocket from Hainan Island, a resort province off the south coast of the mainland, state media said.

Livestreams showed a successful liftoff, with rockets blazing orange and the spacecraft heading upward across clear blue skies. Hundreds of space enthusiasts cried out excitedly on a beach across the bay from the launch site.

It marked the second flight to Mars this week, after a United Arab Emirates orbiter blasted off on a rocket from Japan on Monday. And the U.S. is aiming to launch Perseverance, its most sophisticated Mars rover ever, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, next week.

China's tandem spacecraft — with both an orbiter and a rover — will take seven months to reach Mars, like the others. If all goes well, Tianwen-1, or ""quest for heavenly truth,"" will look for underground water, if it's present, as well as evidence of possible ancient life.

This isn't China's first attempt at Mars. In 2011, a Chinese orbiter accompanying a Russian mission was lost when the spacecraft failed to get out of Earth's orbit after launching from Kazakhstan, eventually burning up in the atmosphere.

This time, China is going at it alone. It also is fast-tracking, launching an orbiter and rover on the same mission instead of stringing them out.

China's secretive space program has developed rapidly in recent decades. Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut in 2003, and last year, Chang'e-4 became the first spacecraft from any country to land on the far side of the moon.

Conquering Mars would put China in an elite club.

""There is a whole lot of prestige riding on this,"" said Dean Cheng, an expert on Chinese aerospace programs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.

Secretive program

Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult. Only the U.S. has successfully landed a spacecraft on Martian soil, doing it eight times since 1976. NASA's InSight and Curiosity rovers still operate today. Six other spacecraft are exploring Mars from orbit: three American, two European and one from India.

Unlike the two other Mars missions launching this month, China has tightly controlled information about the program — even withholding any name for its rover. National security concerns led the U.S. to curb cooperation between NASA and China's space program.

In an article published earlier this month in Nature Astronomy, mission chief engineer Wan Weixing said Tianwen-1 would slip into orbit around Mars in February and look for a landing site on Utopia Planitia — a plain where NASA has detected possible evidence of underground ice. Wan died in May from cancer.

The landing would then be attempted in April or May, according to the article. If all goes well, the 530-pound golf cart-sized, solar-powered rover is expected to operate for about three months, and the orbiter for two years.

Though small compared to America's hulking, car-sized 2,260-pound Perseverance, it's almost twice as big as the two rovers China has sent to the moon in 2013 and 2019. Perseverance is expected to operate for at least two years.

This Mars-launching season — which occurs every 26 months when Earth and Mars are at their closest — is especially busy.

The UAE spacecraft Amal, or Hope, which will orbit Mars but not land, is the Arab world's first interplanetary mission. NASA's Perseverance rover is up next.

25294,2020-07-23 2:21,"Derek Chauvin, ex-cop charged in George Floyd's death, faces 9 tax evasion counts","The former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd was charged Wednesday with multiple felony counts of tax evasion, according to criminal complaints that allege he and his wife didn't report income from various jobs, including more than $95,000 for his off-duty security work.

Derek Chauvin and his wife, Kellie May Chauvin, were each charged in Washington County with six counts of aiding and abetting filing false or fraudulent tax returns in the state of Minnesota and three counts of aiding and abetting failing to file state tax returns.

The complaints allege that from 2014 through 2019, the Chauvins underreported their joint income by $464,433. With unpaid taxes, interest and fees, they now owe $37,868 to the state.

Imran Ali, a Washington County prosecutor, said the charges relate only to tax irregularities in the state of Minnesota, not federal taxes or taxes in Florida, where the couple has a second home. He said the amount of unpaid taxes could increase, as the investigation is ongoing.

Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd pleaded for air. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He and three other officers who were at the scene were fired.

Chauvin is in custody on the charges in the Floyd case. Kellie Chauvin, who filed for divorce after Floyd's death, was not in custody Wednesday. Online court records didn't list attorneys for either in the tax evasion case, and a call to Kellie Chauvin did not go through. Her divorce attorney did not return a call seeking comment. Eric Nelson, Derek Chauvin's attorney on the murder charges, had no comment Wednesday.

The investigation began in June, after the Minnesota Department of Revenue received information about suspicious tax filings by Derek Chauvin. The agency started an internal cursory review, and then opened a formal investigation after determining the Chauvins did not file state taxes as required.

The investigation ultimately found the Chauvins did not file state tax returns for 2016, 2017 and 2018, and did not report all of their income for 2014 and 2015. When tax returns for 2016 through 2019 were filed in June of this year, the Chauvins did not report all of their income in those years either, the complaints said.

Worked off-duty security jobs

The complaints said that as a police officer, Chauvin could work off-duty security jobs and was required to pay taxes on that income. From 2014 through 2020, Chauvin worked off-duty security at several locations.

He worked at El Nuevo Rodeo restaurant nearly every weekend from January 2014 through December 2019, the complaints said. By averaging out his pay of $220 a night over his work schedule at that business, investigators believe he earned about $95,920 over six years that the Chauvins did not report as income.

Kellie Chauvin is a real estate agent and also operates a photography business under the name KC Images. Bank records reviewed by investigators show she or the business received 340 cheques totalling $66,472.75 that were not reported as income in 2014 and 2015, the complaints said.

The complaints allege the Chauvins also failed to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018. Prosecutors say they bought the car in Minnetonka but listed their Florida address as their home address. While the couple lives primarily in Minnesota, Kellie Chauvin told investigators they changed their residency to Florida because it was cheaper to register a car there. They allegedly paid lower sales taxes than they would have paid in Minnesota.

The complaints also allege the Chauvins sold a rental home in Woodbury in 2017 and took a deduction on depreciation to lower their income taxes, but did not properly apply the deduction toward the purchase price of the home as they determined the capital gains tax, resulting in lower taxes being paid.

According to the charges, the Chauvins were sent ""request for missing return"" letters in the fall of 2019, warning them that they had not filed state taxes for 2016 and they could be subjected to criminal penalties if their tax returns were not filed.

When interviewed by investigators, Kellie Chauvin said she knew she had to file tax returns every year, but she had not done so because ""it got away from her,"" according to the complaints.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chauvin-tax-evasion-charged-1.5659867?cmp=rss,news,world,
25282,2020-07-23 0:45,Conservatives call for Morneau's resignation as finance minister says he repaid $41K in WE trip expenses,"Finance Minister Bill Morneau is facing calls to resign after telling MPs that he cut a cheque for over $41,000 to repay travel expenses incurred by the WE organization related to two 2017 trips his family took with the organization.

Morneau said he wrote the cheque today — prior to going before the House of Commons finance committee to answer questions about his government's decision to task WE with administering a $912-million student volunteering program.

Morneau said that after conducting a review of his family's finances in recent days, he found documentation confirming that he already had repaid $52,000 in expenses for hotels and flights related to the trips to Ecuador and Kenya to view the organization's humanitarian work — but failed to locate receipts related to the WE programming he and his family members participated in during the trips.

After reaching out to the WE organization to learn the total amount of expenses WE incurred, Morneau said, he had his assistant write a cheque for $41,366.

""I expected and always had intended to pay the full cost of these trips, and it was my responsibility to make sure that was done,"" Morneau told MPs on the committee.

""Not doing so, even unknowingly, is not appropriate. I want to apologize for this error on my part.""

Morneau also said his family has made two donations totalling $100,000 to the We Charity — one in April 2018 and one in June of this year — to support the charitable organization's work with students in Canada and for COVID-19 relief in Kenya, respectively.

""The work that WE and organizations like them do is important to me,"" Morneau said.

Liberal government embroiled in controversy

The revelations come as the Liberal government is under fire for its close ties to the charity organization it chose to administer its student volunteer program, the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG).

Neither Morneau nor Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who also has family ties to WE — recused themselves from cabinet discussions on awarding the contract, which would have seen WE receive more than $43.5 million to oversee the program.

The decision to give WE sole responsibility for the program has been widely criticized since it emerged that the organization has paid Trudeau's mother and brother hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees, and that Morneau's daughter is employed by WE's travel division.

Both Morneau and Trudeau are being investigated by the federal ethics watchdog for possible violations of conflict of interest rules.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said Canadians will find it hard to believe that Morneau didn't know about thousands of dollars of travel expenses the organization covered — particularly since he's a cabinet minister forbidden from accepting such a benefit.

""We know that this is illegal. We know that you ought to have recused yourself,"" Poilievre said, referring to the decision on the student grant program.

He then called on Morneau to resign.

""Minister, you've lost the moral authority to hold your office.""

WE Charity says it invited the Morneau-McCain family on the trips to see the ""impact of its development projects"" that they funded.

""WE Charity extended the invitation to Nancy McCain and Bill Morneau because they are well-known philanthropists with a history of significant donations to international development programs,"" the organization said in a statement late Wednesday.

""Nancy McCain and her daughter visited WE Charity projects in Kenya in July 2017 as part of a larger tour of local charity programs funded by the Morneau-McCain family.""

Opposition politicians have accused the Liberal government of playing favourites and choosing to reward the organization, formerly known as Free The Children, which is run by well-known philanthropists Craig and Marc Kielburger.

On Tuesday, Clerk of the Privy Council Ian Shugart said he couldn't see not having the finance minister and prime minister involved in discussions about a program as big in scope and price as the CSSG.

However, Canada's top bureaucrat said he wasn't offering a judgment on whether the two should have recused themselves.

A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office backed Morneau in a statement to CBC News.

""Minister Morneau was upfront with the committee and transparent with Canadians today,"" Press Secretary Alex Wellstead said. ""Since the beginning of pandemic, he has worked relentlessly with his colleagues in cabinet to deliver critical support to Canadians. Minister Morneau is continuing to do this work that Canadians rely on.""

Morneau offers details of WE discussions

Morneau offered new details about discussions between his office and WE Charity prior to the June 25 announcement that WE would administer the CSSG.

According to his version of events, officials in his office reached out to WE on April 7 along with a dozen other organizations to solicit ideas for how the government could assist young people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The program that would become the CSSG was still in the development stage.

Two days later, Morneau said, WE submitted a proposal focusing on a social entrepreneurship program. That proposal was unrelated to the CSSG, the details of which were not announced until April 22.

The minister said officials raised the possibility of relying on a third party to administer the CSSG in a briefing with him for the first time on April 18, and cited the WE Charity as an example of a group doing similar work.

In the following days, Morneau said, WE shared a second proposal and discussions continued between his office and WE.

On April 21, Morneau said, he verbally approved the Finance Department's recommendations on the broad parameters of what would become the CSSG, which were announced by Trudeau the next day.

Morneau revealed that he spoke with Craig Kielburger on April 26, but said they discussed the broad impact of COVID-19 and not the details of the CSSG.

Morneau said Youth Minister Bardish Chagger presented her initial proposal to have WE administer the CSSG to the special COVID-19 cabinet committee on May 7, with the final approval from the full cabinet coming on May 22.

""I regret that my not recusing myself has been a reason that students have not been able to get the support on a timely basis,"" Morneau said.

Witnesses criticize WE Charity

In testimony before the committee today, two witnesses criticized the WE organization for its complicated organizational structure, financial dealings and employment practices.

Jesse Brown, publisher of the media organization Canadaland, walked the committee through his organization's reporting on WE's financial affairs, workplace issues, real estate holdings and legal troubles in Kenya.

Brown alleges the organization has misused public funds, mistreated young workers and volunteers and hired private investigators to investigate reporters.

The director of a humanitarian organization that planned to employ students through the program expressed frustration over its collapse.

""We've recruited students to participate and now I'm very concerned that the students will not get a bursary,"" said Rahul Singh, executive director of Global Medic, which provides disaster relief to countries affected by natural disasters.

Singh said his Toronto-based organization had spaces for 840 students per week to do things like assemble aid packages. Global Medic had entered into a partnership agreement with WE Charity when the organization became the administrator of the program.

Singh said that after WE pulled out, he reached out to Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's office but hasn't heard back from the government about the future of the program.

""I'm very worried about people falling through the cracks because of poor policy decisions and how they adversely impact people,"" Singh said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/finance-committee-morneau-we-charity-1.5658627,news,politics,finance-committee-morneau-we-charity-1.5658627

The Dash, who had never made the playoffs in seven seasons in the league, defeated the Portland Thorns 1-0 in the earlier semifinal.

The sixth-seeded Red Stars built a 3-0 lead in the game but No. 7 Sky Blue scored a pair of goals late.

The match had looked like it could be a battle of the goalkeepers after both teams went scoreless in the quarterfinals and advanced to the semis on penalty shootouts.

Sky Blue goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan went into the game leading the field with 20 saves in the tournament. Chicago counterpart Alyssa Naeher had 18 saves, but rested for a game during the group stage.

St. Georges got past Sheridan early, finding her out of place with a shot to the far post in the eighth minute. It was her first professional goal.

Guerrero took a 3-2 pitch from lefty Brian Johnson over the Green Monster in left field with Cavan Biggio aboard for two runs in the top of the fourth inning, breaking open a scoreless game that was called off in the middle of the fifth because of weather.

Thornton allowed just one hit and struck out three with no walks, facing a total of 10 batters before giving way to Shun Yamaguchi. Yamaguchi gave up one hit in an inning of relief.

Boston starter Zack Godley didn't allow a hit, with one walk and two strikeouts before Johnson came on for two innings.

Jays shortstop Bo Bichette made a highlight-reel play in the field when he dove towards the hole towards third to snag a grounder before getting up and throwing to first to get J.D. Martinez by a stride in the bottom of the third.

25337,2020-07-22 22:20,B.C. legislation to detain youth who overdose could do more harm than good: doctor,"Indigenous and civil liberties groups say the British Columbia government failed to consult them before proposing legislation that would force youth under 19 to stay in hospital after an overdose.

The province announced its plan to amend the Mental Health Act last month, saying youth could be kept in care for up to seven days in order to stabilize them and create a treatment plan that would involve parents.

However, the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and the B.C. Civil Liberties Association are among groups that say the government didn't ask for their input on legislation that may stop youth from accessing care if they're detained against their will.

They're demanding the proposed legislation be withdrawn, especially as fatal overdoses increase, with a monthly record of 175 deaths last month.

An addictions specialist at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver says he was ""very surprised"" to see the proposed changes in the legislation. (Tina Lovgreen/CBC)

Judy Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said Indigenous youth would be most affected by the changes and instead need support services before they overdose and end up in an emergency department.

""If the province had talked to some of these families and advocates there could have been a lot more suggested, instead of unilateral changes,"" Wilson said.

""More alternative programs than just hospitalization are needed,"" she said, adding long wait lists for programs and treatment leave youth without hope as drug use becomes entrenched and families end up in crisis.

""There aren't enough programs so it ends up being the only solution, to leave them in the psych ward, in an institutional setting,"" Wilson said. ""And of course youth rebel because they don't want to be in a hospital.""

Few treatment beds

The Mental Health and Addictions Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Minister Judy Darcy has said the proposed changes could help ensure the immediate safety of young people and provide them with support after they're discharged.

However, Dr. Keith Ahamad, an addictions specialist at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, said there aren't enough treatment beds available for either youth or adults.

Ahamad was among the physicians and public health experts consulted about the proposed legislation but he said their concerns weren't taken into consideration.

""Everyone was very surprised to see the proposed changes,"" Ahamad said, adding youth fearing they could be detained in hospital will no longer trust doctors trying to treat them.

""I see this hugely, disproportionately affecting Indigenous youth and as they age. The therapeutic relationship and the potential for me to provide care for these youth is significantly impacted when they're treated like this. The scientific evidence suggests that, as well as the clinical experience.""

Detaining youth for seven days would also lower their tolerance to street drugs, which is particularly problematic as substances have become more toxic during COVID-19, Ahamad said of disruptions to the normal supply due to border closures.

""A 17-year-old doesn't want to be forced into doing anything that they don't want to do. And if best evidence suggested that this would be effective and potentially lead to improved outcomes then of course we would advocate for it.""

He said rather than amending the law, there's an urgent need for the province to provide a comprehensive system of support.

""Currently within British Columbia we don't have a functioning system of care within the community. We have people admitted to withdrawal management centres within acute care settings and we discharge them to nothing,"" he said.

""To me, as a parent and a scientist and a clinician, that is the crux of the issue. We're not looking after patients when they leave hospitals and that's the real downfall of the system.""

Prominent groups not consulted

The B.C. Centre on Substance Use was also not consulted by the province, and neither were drug users' groups or Moms Stop the Harm, a national support group of about 1,300 parents whose children are struggling through addiction or have died of an overdose.

Leslie McBain, a spokeswoman for the latter group's chapter representing 650 members in British Columbia, said that while the intention behind the proposed legislation is good, it is ""fundamentally flawed.""

""If a kid ever wanted to recover from drugs and ever had the idea there was something for them this might just dash their hopes,"" McBain said.

""If the individual is scared or threatened and doesn't want their parents to know and wants out, it's not conducive to healing,"" she said.

""I think the government should step back, look at it again given the criticism and pushback they received and do some more consulting.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-overdose-detain-legislation-1.5659762?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25292,2020-07-22 22:06,'We failed': Sask. Health Authority apologizes for its actions prior to death of B.C. man,"The Saskatchewan Health Authority has apologized to the family of Samwel Uko for failing to provide him timely assistance before his death in May.

The 20-year-old from Abbotsford, B.C., who was in Regina visiting an aunt, died on May 21 after drowning in Wascana Lake. Prior to his death, Uko sought help at the Regina General Hospital while in the throes of a mental health crisis.

""I extend this apology and condolences on behalf of the Saskatchewan Health Authority to your entire family, and most especially you, Samwel's parents,"" the provincial health authority's CEO Scott Livingstone said in a letter obtained by CBC.

""Your vibrant young son sought help from us and we failed to provide him the timely assistance he needed.""

Uko's family says he died by suicide after seeking help at the hospital. The Saskatchewan Coroners Service confirmed his body was found in the lake, but wouldn't confirm the cause of death, saying an investigation is underway.

""I appreciate there are no words that can bring Samwel back, but I want you to know that we recognize how deeply we failed him,"" Livingstone said in his letter.

Uko's uncle Justin Paul said the family accepts the health authority's apology, but is still reeling.

""This is still a hard topic to the family. We are trying to make sense of everything,"" Paul said in a short statement.

Last month, Uko's family said he visited the Regina General Hospital twice on the day he died. The second time, he was escorted out by security just a couple of hours before he was found dead, the family said.

Uko kept telling hospital staff that he needed help, as seen in a Snapchat video that he posted.

Samwel Uko was found dead in Wascana Lake on Thursday. His family says he died after seeking help. Uko posted this video to Snapchat. 0:19

Before his final moments, Uko wrote on Facebook, ""I need help."" He also texted his former teacher, ""Please help me, they are after me, they are coming to kill me.""

His uncle and father said they didn't see any signs that Uko had mental health issues until he said he was hearing voices in his head.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority is currently reviewing Uko's second visit to the hospital. Uko's family has agreed to assist the SHA in its review of the incident.

SHA promises to improve services

Livingstone said that beyond any recommendations that come from the review, the health authority is committed to enhancing access to mental health supports in the province.

""Samwel's tragic experience with our health system will strengthen our resolve to advance this work,"" he said in the letter.

The SHA said it will provide more information on Thursday.

Last month, the health authority said Uko's case was a ""critical incident,"" defined as ""a serious adverse health event including, but not limited to, the actual or potential loss of life … related to a health service provided by, or a program operated by, a health-care organization.""

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has also said the coroner's service will conduct a public inquest into the death of Samwel Uko.

Uko's family has also called for adequate mental health services for Black communities in the province. Saskatchewan has no such services tailored to the specific needs of those communities.

Experts say the province needs to collect data on mental health in Black communities in order to improve services.

Uko, who was originally from what is now South Sudan, came to Canada with his family as a refugee in 2005.

He started playing football soon after his arrival in his new home in B.C., and the sport became his passion. He played for a season with the University of Saskatchewan Huskies.

Samwel Uko, 20, has been remembered by his friends and football teammates for his big smile, kind heart and love of the game. (Remembering Samwel Uko/Facebook)

Police from La Loche and Prince Albert conducted an investigation, which included multiple interviews and a forensic audit of the First Nation, the release said.

That audit revealed more than $1 million in losses to the First Nation, located just over 500 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon, police said.

25344,2020-07-22 20:05,B.C. doctor heads to court to demand mandatory mask rules,"A family doctor in Burnaby, B.C., is asking for a court injunction requiring the province to bring in a mandatory mask policy for indoor spaces like restaurants, schools and public transit.

Dr. Wei Li filed a notice of application in B.C. Supreme Court Thursday morning, calling for Health Minister Adrian Dix to be restrained from allowing B.C. to continue operating in Phase 3 of the COVID-19 pandemic response without requiring masks in indoor, public environments.

""Reopening communities while failing to require citizens to wear masks in public during a global pandemic is akin to allowing everyone to drive in a windowless car at 300 km/h in a hurricane without the need to wear a seatbelt,"" the notice of application says.

It states that Li ""is persistently worried and anxious that her community, her loved ones and herself may contract COVID-19.""

The application suggests masks should be required in ""restaurants, bars, hospitals, public transit, retail stores, educational institutions and theatres, provided that there are appropriate exemptions available for infants and those who are unable to wear a mask.""

Concerns about asymptomatic spread

During Phase 3 , many services including movie theatres and churches have been allowed to reopen at reduced capacity, and the government is once again encouraging residents to travel within the province.

Right now, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry generally recommends wearing a mask in situations like riding the bus, where physical distancing isn't possible.

She has so far resisted calls to make masks mandatory in indoor spaces, saying it's too difficult to enforce — especially when some people have legitimate reasons for not wearing a mask that may not be readily apparent to others.

Li's application lays out the steady increase in new confirmed cases reported daily in recent weeks, and notes that B.C. has one of the lowest testing rates in the country.

Provincial officials have resisted making face masks mandatory in public spaces. (Ben Nelms/CBC)

""The prevalence of asymptomatic spread makes universal masking an essential means to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" the application reads.

""The respondent endangers public health by failing to provide strong, clear and consistent recommendations in respect of the urgent need for widespread masking in public in-door environments where the risk of transmission is high.""

Li also questions the strategy of emphasizing physical distancing over wearing masks, suggesting it isn't always possible to predict when someone might break the recommended two-metre barrier.

""When an individual realizes that someone has come too close to them, it may be too late to put on a mask and the transmission may have already occurred,"" the application says.

Epidemiologist says masks are 'common sense'

David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto, said he doesn't know enough about B.C.'s internal politics to say whether legal action is the best course of action.

But he described more widespread mask use as ""one of the easy wins"" for getting the COVID-19 epidemic back under control.

""One of the frustrations with this disease is that we think about 50 per cent of all transmission of COVID happens in people before they have symptoms, and that's a very difficult problem to deal with,"" Fisman told CBC.

Everything from breathing to talking to singing and coughing produces droplets that could carry the novel coronavirus, and wearing masks can cut down significantly on the droplets that reach those around you.

As Henry revealed earlier this week, B.C.'s COVID-19 reproductive number has now jumped above one — which means each person who has the disease is now infecting more than one other person. That means we are creating conditions where the curve of infection is no longer flat.

""Masks should be a way to take that reproduction number down a few notches,"" Fisman said. ""It's a common sense way to maintain economic activity while also doing easy stuff to prevent the virus from transmitting.""

25278,2020-07-22 19:34,"In contrast to most Americans polled, Trump 'comfortable' with sending son back to school","Virtual instruction. Mandated masks. Physical distancing. The start of school will look very different this year because of the coronavirus — and that's OK with the vast majority of Americans.

Only about 1 in 10 Americans think daycare centres, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. Most think mask requirements and other safety measures are necessary to restart in-person instruction, and roughly 3 in 10 say that teaching kids in classrooms shouldn't happen at all.

The findings are a sharp contrast to the picture that U.S. President Donald Trump paints as he pressures schools to reopen. Trump said Wednesday that he would be ""comfortable"" with his son Barron and grandchildren attending school in person this fall.

""I would like to see the schools open,"" he told reporters.

Few schools, however, plan to return to business as usual. Many of the nation's largest school districts have announced that they'll be entirely virtual in the fall or use a hybrid model that has children in classrooms only a couple of days a week.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at the White House on Wednesday. (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)

The poll finds only 8 per cent of Americans say K-12 schools should open for normal in-person instruction. Just 14 per cent think they can reopen with minor adjustments, while 46 per cent think major adjustments are needed. Another 31 per cent think instruction should not be in person this fall. It's little different among the parents of school-age children.

The poll also shows Americans feel the same about colleges and universities reopening this fall.

Americans show little confidence in Trump's handling of education issues. Only 36 per cent say they approve of Trump's performance, while 63 per cent disapprove. But a stark political divide on opening schools suggests many Republicans are taking cues from the president.

About 9 in 10 Democrats say requiring students and staff to wear masks is essential to reopening, while only about half of Republicans say the same. Democrats are roughly twice as likely as Republicans to say schools should use a mix of in-person and virtual instruction to reduce the number of students in buildings, 77 per cent to 39 per cent.

Patty Kasbek, of Bartlesville, Okla., said she desperately wants her two children, ages 5 and 10, to return to school. After months at home, the family is stressed and anxious. But with the virus surging, she doesn't see a safe way to reopen.

""School shouldn't even be considered right now,"" said Kasbek, 40. ""We need to get this under control before we play with the virus. It's just too dangerous to put our kids out there like guinea pigs.""

Her local school district is planning to reopen with new safety measures, she said, but she's opting to enrol her children in a virtual school. She isn't as worried about her own health but fears that reopening schools could spread the virus to others.

""I just see it going very badly, and I'm very, very worried for the teachers,"" said Kasbek, who considers herself a Democrat.

The poll finds a majority of Americans, 56 per cent, say they are very or extremely concerned that reopening schools will lead to additional infections in their communities; another 24 per cent are somewhat concerned.

Some, however, see little risk. James Rivers, of Ramsey, Minnesota, said schools should reopen without protective measures against the virus. Rivers, a Republican, says Trump is doing a ""fine job"" and will have his vote in November.

""I think it should be just business as usual,"" said Rivers, 54. ""Yes, there is a COVID virus, but is it any more deadly than the common flu? I don't think so.""

Teachers hold a car parade protest in front of the Pasco County School district office in Land O' Lakes, Fla., on Tuesday. (Octavio Jones/Reuters)

Rivers, who does not have school-age children, said parents who fear the virus can home school. ""As for everybody else who isn't afraid of a virus that has a less than 2 per cent chance of being fatal, send your kid back to school. Let's get it done,"" he said.

Majorities say it is essential that buildings be disinfected daily, temperature checks and face masks be mandatory and desks be spread apart if schools are to reopen.

And 6 in 10 think a mix of in-person and virtual instruction is necessary, to limit the number of students inside at one time. Some of the nation's largest districts, including New York City's schools, plan to use that model. But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says that fails students and taxpayers, arguing that students should be in the classroom every day.

Trump at odds with own health officials

In his campaign to reopen schools, Trump argues that Democrats oppose it for political reasons. He has threatened to cut federal funding for schools that fail to reopen fully. The White House has said he wants to work with Congress to tie future relief funding to reopening. He argues that other countries have reopened schools safely, although some he cites have used the hybrid model that DeVos decried.

The Trump administration also has argued that it's not just about academics. Students need access to meal programs and mental health services, it says.

But Trump's demands put him at odds with his own health officials. He rebuked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for releasing school guidelines that he said were too tough.

The poll finds about half of parents saying they are at least somewhat concerned about their child losing services like school lunches or counselling because of the pandemic.

More say they are worried about their child falling behind academically: 55 per cent are very concerned, with another 21 per cent somewhat concerned.

A majority of parents, 65 per cent, are at least somewhat concerned about their own ability to juggle responsibilities.

Jimmy La Londe, 70, of Hiawassee, Ga., thinks schools should reopen with safety measures that local officials think are necessary. Still, La Londe, who considers himself a Republican, said keeping schools closed will only hurt students and anger taxpayers.

""They have to keep the momentum, they have to keep people used to going to school,"" he said. ""I don't think you can stop school forever.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-schools-son-grandchildren-schools-covid-19-coronavirus-1.5659497?cmp=rss,news,world,

The party has been hosting regional town halls as part of its leadership contest during the pandemic.

During Tuesday night's debate focused on the Prairie region, an anti-Black slur was directed at candidate Annamie Paul through the meeting's chat service. An anti-Semitic slur was repeated several times, directed at candidate Meryam Haddad.

""In the chat some comments popped up, one used the word 'N' several times. The other one referred to another candidate as an 'f-ing Jew,'"" Paul said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos.

The All-Star right-hander was expected to follow two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom in a rotation that already will be without No. 2 starter Noah Syndergaard all year because of Tommy John surgery.

Mets manager Luis Rojas said the team doesn't anticipate Stroman needing surgery and he will be evaluated on a week-to-week basis. But with the coronavirus-delayed season shortened to 60 games, it could be difficult for Stroman to return in time to provide much help.

""It's really unfortunate,"" Rojas said.

New York opens up Friday at home against the Atlanta Braves.

The 5-foot-7 Stroman, an energetic bundle of unwavering confidence, grew up on Long Island about 50 miles from Citi Field. He was acquired from Toronto before the trade deadline last July and is eligible for free agency after this season.

Stroman made his first all-star team with Toronto last year. He was 6-11 with a 2.96 ERA in 21 starts for the Blue Jays before going 4-2 with a 3.77 ERA for the Mets.

25275,2020-07-22 18:15,Canadian contingent helps Dash push past Thorns to reach Challenge Cup final,"Rachel Daly scored on a header in the 69th minute and the Houston Dash advanced to the Challenge Cup title game with a 1-0 victory over the Portland Thorns on Wednesday.

The fourth-seeded Dash, the highest remaining seed in the tournament, had never been to the playoffs in seven years in the National Women's Soccer League.

The Dash will play the winner of the late semifinal match between the Chicago Red Stars and Sky Blue in the championship game Sunday.

Canadian international Nichelle Prince had a couple of chances for Houston. She broke away in a sprint toward Portland's goal in the opening half Wednesday but she was caught by defender Emily Menges. Daly had the lone shot on goal for the Dash in the scoreless half.

Prince had another great opportunity in the 62nd minute but Portland goalkeeper Britt Eckerstrom punched it away.

Daly finally broke through with her rebound goal that bounced off Eckerstrom's back and into the net. It was Daly's third goal of the tournament and ended a three-match shutout for the Dash.

Fellow Canadians Allysha Chapman and Sophie Schmidt joined Prince in Houston's starting 11.

Star Canadian striker Christine Sinclair is Portland's captain.

Portland went into the tournament with an 11-2-3 advantage all-time against the Dash.

The Thorns, who won league titles in 2013 and 2017, were hampered by injuries during the Challenge Cup.

Starting goalkeeper Adrianna Franch didn't play because of a knee injury, and defender Becky Sauerbrunn hadn't played since the opener because of a hip injury. The Thorns on Wednesday were also without midfielder Lindsey Horan, who was questionable going into the game with a hip injury.

Portland was also down to the team's third goalkeeper. Eckerstrom started the last two games after Bella Bixby sustained an ACL injury and headed home. As a result, goalkeeping coach Nadine Angerer, the former German national team goalkeeper and FIFA player of the year, was on Portland's bench as a backup.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/houston-dash-portland-thorns-nwsl-recap-1.5659479?cmp=rss,sports,soccer,

The outfielder, who turns 28 in October, was acquired by the Dodgers from the Boston Red Sox on Feb. 10 along with pitcher David Price for three players.

Betts had agreed to a $27 million, one-year deal with the Red Sox, a salary that has been reduced to $10 million in prorated pay because of the shortened season.

His deal is baseball's second-largest in total dollars behind the $426.5 million, 12-year contract for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout covering 2019-30. Betts' average salary of $30.42 million trails Gerrit Cole ($36 million), Trout ($35.5 million), Stephen Strasburg and Anthony Rendon ($35 million each), Zack Greinke ($34.4 million), Justin Verlander $31.3 million), and new teammates Price and Clayton Kershaw ($31 million each).

A four-time Gold Glove winner, Betts won the 2018 AL MVP award en route to Boston's World Series title. He hit .295 with 29 homers and 80 RBIs last year, down from a major league-leading .346 average with 32 homers and 80 RBIs in his MVP season.

25271,2020-07-22 17:46,6 things to know for this weird baseball season,"This is an excerpt from The Buzzer, which is CBC Sports' daily email newsletter. Stay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here.

Baseball is back, but in a very weird way

In a normal year, Major League Baseball would be entering the dog days of the season right about now. But nothing about this year is normal. So instead of half-paying-attention to a bunch of mostly meaningless mid-summer games tomorrow night, baseball fans will be tuning in for a pair of season openers. And we do mean tuning in, because no spectators are allowed in stadiums this year.

The 2020 regular season — drastically shortened by both the pandemic and the ensuing labour battle — starts Thursday night with Yankees-Nationals at 7 p.m. ET and Giants-Dodgers at 10 p.m. ET. The rest of the teams open Friday — including the Toronto Blue Jays, who visit the Tampa Bay Rays at 6:40 p.m. ET.

Since the season is starting about four months later than usual, you might be a little foggy on the big storylines. So here are a few things to know before Dr. Anthony Fauci throws out the first pitch in Washington:

The schedule is a lot more compact

This is true in terms of both time and space. Rather than 162 games, teams are playing just 60. Forty of these are against the other four teams in their division. The other 20 are against the teams in the geographically corresponding division in the opposite league. So if you're in the American League East, you play against the National League East.

The regular season ends on Sept. 27 and will be followed by the standard post-season tournament beginning Sept. 29. The World Series is scheduled to be over by Oct. 28.

3 big rule changes go into effect

The first two ideas have been kicked around for years and finally got pushed through as part of the hastily reworked labour deal: The designated hitter will be used in National League games for the first time ever, and in extra innings each team will start with a runner on second base. The latter rule will not be used in the post-season.

The other change was approved before the pandemic hit. In an effort to reduce the number of pitching changes (a big gripe among fans in recent years), each reliever must face a minimum of three batters, unless the inning ends before that happens.

The Blue Jays have a lot going on

As rebuilding years go, 2019 was pretty successful for Toronto. The trick in this situation is to distract your fans from all the losing with a few exciting moments and some reasons to be optimistic about the future. The Blue Jays supplied both.

In April, they made the most hyped minor-league callup baseball has seen in years when they promoted Vladimir Guerrero Jr. He didn't exactly set the league on fire, but he hit very well for a 20-year-old and remains on track to be a star. Later in the season, the Jays brought up another exciting prospect in Bo Bichette. While not as powerful as Guerrero, the wiry shortstop turned heads right away by reeling off an 11-game hitting streak to start his big-league career. The doubles machine finished with a.311 batting average and a 144 OPS+ — phenomenal stats for someone who was only 21. Toronto could have a third second-generation star in the making in Cavan Biggio. Like Guerrero and Bichette, he's the son of a former major-league standout. Biggio is 25, so he doesn't have the upside of the other two, but he hit 16 homers and stole 14 bases in only 100 games last year, which is promising.

The Jays added a good pitcher in free agency by signing former Dodger Hyun-jin Ryu. The Korean lefty will start the opener and should be the ace of a questionable starting rotation.

Pitching is suddenly not the team's biggest worry, though. The Jays are still looking for a home after the Canadian government rejected their plan to play out of their own stadium, like every other team in baseball. A deal to share the Pittsburgh Pirates' park appeared to be close, but it fell through today when local officials didn't approve. Other possibilities include finding a different team to share a stadium with, hopping around between multiple parks, or setting up shop in Buffalo (home to the Jays' triple-A affiliate) or Dunedin, Fla. (their spring-training headquarters).

Also, Toronto still plays in a merciless division. The Yankees are co-favourites (with the L.A. Dodgers) to win the World Series, the Rays always field a strong team despite their budget constraints, and the Red Sox remain dangerous despite being too cheap to give superstar Mookie Betts a new contract and trading him to the Dodgers. So the short season could feel like a long one for the Jays.

The Nationals look like one-hit wonders

It's hard enough for a great team to win back-to-back championships in this sport. A wild-card team that started 19-31 and survived three elimination games in the playoffs? And whose best everyday player left in free agency? Let's just say the odds of Washington becoming baseball's first repeat champion since the 1999-2000 Yankees aren't great.

That's not to suggest the Nationals didn't deserve their rings. After that bumpy start, they really hit their stride and forged themselves into a formidable post-season team. They knocked off the championship-favourite Dodgers, humiliated St. Louis and then upset the heavily favoured Astros in the World Series. But they're really going to miss slugging third baseman Anthony Rendon, who signed with the Angels. Ace pitcher Max Scherzer turns 36 next week and his body broke down in last year's playoffs. Sous-ace Stephen Strasburg is 32, injury prone and coming off the biggest workload of his career (which happened, conveniently for him, in a contract year).

The Dodgers hope this is finally their year

L.A. has probably been the best team in baseball since 2013. They've won seven division titles in a row and captured two National League pennants in that span. But they have zero championships to show for it, and their World Series title drought now stands at 32 years.

Last year was especially crushing for the Dodgers. They won a franchise-record 106 games in the regular season and were heavily favoured to reach their third World Series in a row. Instead, they lost their opening playoff matchup to Washington.

So L.A. isn't fooling around this year. Even though their roster was already stacked, they poached the MVP-calibre Betts from Boston for pennies on the dollar. The other big piece in that trade, pitcher David Price, decided to opt out of the season over health concerns, but L.A. is so loaded that it might not matter much.

The Dodgers should cruise to another division title, and they're big favourites to win the NL pennant. But that won't be good enough. Only a World Series title will do this year. They're all in. That's a tough spot to be in for a season that could feature a lot of randomness.

Everybody hates the Astros

With the exception of maybe Jeff Bezos and a few guys like him, it's hard to say the pandemic has been good for anyone. But if you had to pick the group of people in baseball for whom it's been the least bad, that would be the Houston Astros.

The big story from spring training, right up until it shut down, was the Astros' going full heel in the wake of the cheating scandal that cost manager A.J. Hinch and GM Jeff Luhnow their jobs and further tarnished the reputation of a franchise that was already trending toward villainy last year. Rather than show up this spring humbled and seeking forgiveness, several members of the team downplayed the signal-stealing scheme that helped them win the World Series in 2017. This infuriated rival players and their fans. Beanballs and boos awaited the Astros at every ballpark they visited this season.

WATCH | Astros prepare for return to field amid scrutiny over cheating scandal:

As it prepares to resume during the pandemic, Major League Baseball is also wrestling with the legacy of a cheating scandal involving World Series champions, the Houston Astros. 8:21

But time has a way of dulling emotions, and a global pandemic has a way of putting things in perspective. Plus, the stands will be empty this season. So the Astros will be spared the venom they'd have faced in a normal year — at least from fans. On Wednesday night, Houston stars Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman and George Springer all got plunked by Royals pitchers during an exhibition game.

The Astros are still a top title contender. They're favoured to win the AL West for the fourth straight time and they have one of the best rosters in baseball — even after losing co-ace Gerrit Cole in free agency to the Yankees. But they'll have to be able to take the heat.

25273,2020-07-22 17:18,B.C. announces new rules for bars and nightclubs as COVID-19 cases continue to climb,"Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced Wednesday that new measures will be brought in for bars and nightclubs as the province's COVID-19 numbers creep upwards.

Thirty-four new cases were announced in the province on Wednesday, bringing the total to 3,362 cases in the province. No new deaths were announced.

B.C. saw a spike in new infections over the weekend, with 102 new confirmed cases between Friday and Monday, and 30 more on Tuesday. Henry said that 70 cases have now been linked to events and parties in the Kelowna area over the past several weeks.

All patrons in bars and nightclubs will be required to be seated, alcohol self-service will not be available, and dance floors will be closed.

""The B.C. COVID-19 curve is trending in a direction we don't want it to go — upwards,"" said Henry.

""There are close to 1,000 British Columbians self-isolating at home;. This means people are unable to work, see friends, enjoy the summer.""

Henry said the current focus is to support the people currently in self-isolation, some of whom are likely to contract COVID-19 in the coming week.

But she said she does not believe the province moved into Phase 3 of its gradual reopening too quickly, although B.C. residents do need to renew their commitment to keep gatherings small and maintain physical distancing.

""We have been very measured. It is not surprising to me as people are travelling more, that we have more cases. People are getting together with small groups, but different groups every night,"" she said.

""We need people to start paying attention again. Every time you meet a group of new people, you're exposing yourself to new risk. We need to get on top of it.""

Responding to questions about images that circulated of a large crowd of people drumming and dancing close together on a Vancouver beach Tuesday night, Henry said that while the risk of spread is lower outside, people should still be gathering in smaller groups.

""We don't want lots of people to crowd together for periods of time, having close conversations. It's not zero risk outside. Keep a safe distance from other small groups. Then you can enjoy the beach, you can enjoy the water, the sunsets around B.C.,"" she said.

Dix said that while large outdoor gatherings often garner significant public attention, the majority of residents are adhering to public health advice.

Henry said younger people tend to experience milder symptoms, but some people experience prolonged symptoms and can be ill for a very long time.

""Even people who have milder illness [can have] a prolonged recovery that takes weeks — profound tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath. Even if you feel young and healthy and [think] you're going to be fine, there are people in their 20s and 30s who have died from this,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/update-covid-19-bc-july-22-1.5656611?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25272,2020-07-22 17:13,"Therese Brisson, ex-national hockey player, named Alpine Canada president, CEO","A decorated Canadian women's hockey player has stepped to the helm of Alpine Canada.

Therese Brisson is the new president and chief executive officer of Canada's governing body of skiing. She replaces Vania Grandi, who resigned in May just short of two and a half years in the job.

Brisson won an Olympic gold medal in 2002 in Salt Lake City, as well as a silver in 1998 when women's hockey made its Olympic debut in Nagano, Japan. The captain of the national team from 1999 to 2001 earned six world championship gold medals during her career.

A broken ankle and subsequent surgeries on it contributed to the defender's retirement prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics.

""Still not an Olympic ankle, but that matters less in a ski boot,"" Brisson told The Canadian Press.

The 53-year-old from Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Que., has worked as a sales and marketing executive for consumer product companies since retiring from hockey. She's also been a director with the Canadian Olympic Committee and spent a decade serving as Own The Podium's corporate secretary and treasurer.

Brisson takes over one of Canada's largest sports organizations Aug. 4 during a pandemic wreaking havoc across global sport.

Sport and business clout

""The challenge of building the brand and the business all in service of helping our athletes and coaches be on the podium is something that's very exciting and attractive to me,"" Brisson said. ""If it was a business-as-usual assignment, I don't think I would have been as excited to join.""

She understands what competitive sport looks like and she understands ... what winning looks like. That's a big asset in winning over athletes' trust. —Alpine Canada's Erik Guay on new president/CEO Therese Brisson

Former world alpine champion Erik Guay is a member of Alpine Canada's board.

Retired in 2018, the most decorated man in Canadian ski racing says Brisson brings both sport and business clout to table.

""We were looking for somebody who was very financially savvy, who has some good marketing repertoire,"" Guay said. ""Me personally, I was looking for somebody to lead us and I didn't know what that would look like exactly. This has been a new process for me to interview candidates.

""I can say we interviewed quite a few. I can say Therese stood out from the crowd early on. The fact Therese is not coming from a competitive alpine skiing background, she understands what competitive sport looks like and she understands, most importantly, what winning looks like. That's a big asset in winning over the athletes' trust.""

Alpine Canada's stated goal is to be a top-three skiing nation by 2026. Canada is already there in ski cross and para-alpine, but not yet in alpine racing.

""The timeline might be aggressive, but it's something I think we should certainly aspire to,"" Brisson said.

The Canadian ski team is shifting out of a pandemic hiatus with alpine skiers on the verge of returning to snow. Women's team veteran Valerie Grenier travelled to Switzerland this week and others are expected to join her for the 2020-21 season.

Lake Louise downhill slated for November, December

""We have extensive health protocols in place, which among other things requires getting tested prior to leaving and upon arrival in Switzerland,"" Guay said. ""These aren't mandatory trips. We told the athletes if they're at all uncomfortable with travelling during these times, completely understandable.""

Whether they'll get the chance to compete in international races at home is another pandemic question.

The men's and women's downhill in Lake Louise, Alta., in November and December is a staple on the World Cup calendar.

A World Cup ski cross at Nakiska Ski Resort west of Calgary originally scheduled for Jan. 16, 2021 no longer appears on the world governing body's calendar. FIS has delayed decisions on next season's schedule until mid-August.

""There's a lot of uncertainty right now, a lot of speculation what the season is going to look like, what's going to be cancelled, what's going to remain on the schedule,"" Guay said. ""We really have no idea what the coming season is going to look like.""

Brisson is undaunted by the turbulence.

""For all sport, not just alpine but certainly alpine, it's going to be a season unlike any other we've had that's for sure,"" she said. ""Not everyone signs up for this, but this is an important sport in our country.

""There will be financial challenges related to this, return to sport and training challenges and then there will be event challenges as well. It's truthfully what I was looking for, the challenge.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/alpineskiing/therese-brisson-alpine-canada-1.5659349?cmp=rss,sports,olympics,winter
25347,2020-07-22 17:02,"More COVID-19 deaths at for-profit nursing homes in Ontario, study finds","For-profit long-term care homes in Ontario saw significantly worse outbreaks of COVID-19 and more related deaths than their non-profit or municipally run counterparts, according to a new study released on Wednesday.

The paper in the peer-reviewed Canadian Medical Association Journal raises questions about the ownership status of nursing homes, a factor the association that speaks for the facilities said last year had no impact on quality of care.

The research looked at all 623 long-term care homes in Ontario, from March 29 — the date of the first reported case of coronavirus in a home — until May 20. Collectively, the facilities housed more than 75,000 seniors — most of them with multiple health conditions, both physical and cognitive.

In all, more than 5,200 residents contracted COVID-19 during the study period. More than one quarter of those infected — 1,450 — died.

In Ontario, 57 per cent of nursing homes are set up to be profit-making — the highest rate in the country. Another 26 per cent are non-profit and 16 per cent are municipally run. While profit status had no impact on whether a facility had a coronavirus outbreak, the study finds, it did play a significant role in what happened if one occurred.

""We did find evidence that for-profit LTC homes have larger COVID-19 outbreaks and more deaths of residents from COVID-19 than non-profit and municipal homes,"" the study finds. ""Those with older design standards appear to show worse outcomes.""

The study, co-authored by Dr. Nathan Stall with the Sinai Health System and University Health Network in Toronto, also suggests chain-operated for-profit homes — 85 per cent of the commercial facilities — run a significantly higher risk of worse COVID outcomes.

An accompanying commentary notes upgrading facilities — many beds are at or below 1972 standards — likely won't fix the situation at for-profits if further research confirms chain ownership is a key factor on its own.

Dr. Samir Sinha, a Toronto-based geriatrician not involved in the study, said 30,000 long-term care beds in Ontario are in dire need of upgrades.

""Many of these older multi-bedded homes happen to be owned by for-profits,"" Sinha said. ""The study really speaks to the need to redevelop that.""

The government of Premier Doug Ford initially promised to build 15,000 beds in five years and redevelop another 15,000, Sinha said. However, only a relative handful have been built or redeveloped, and the government has now significantly tempered its ambitions.

Last week, the government announced it is changing the way it funds long-term care home expansions in a bid to spur construction, while conceding it would now pay for 8,000 new beds, and 12,000 renovated beds in the same five-year period.

In the interim, it has also limited room occupancy to two, further exacerbating bed shortages.

The Ontario Long Term Care association, which speaks for nursing homes and has complained about underfunding, did not respond to a request for comment on the study.

Separately Wednesday, the Ontario Health Coalition said 95 per cent of staff in the province's nursing homes reported basic care needs of residents — such as bathing, oral care and emotional support — were going unmet due to staff shortages.

Others said they didn't have enough time to properly feed residents, get them to the washroom on time, or make sure they didn't develop pressure ulcers — a situation especially problematic at night and on weekends. Most respondents reported the situation had worsened since the pandemic hit in March.

In response, Ford said the survey findings show why his government passed ongoing emergency powers to be able to ""flow staff from the hospitals into long-term care.""

Previous research has shown staffing levels play a key role in COVID-19 outcomes, with one California study finding under-staffing doubled the chances of residents' becoming infected.

""If requirements to fund adequate levels of staffing affect the bottom lines of for-profit facilities, then it might be time for this care to be turned over to public and non-profit entities,"" the journal commentary says.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-ltc-study-1.5659224?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
25269,2020-07-22 17:00,Black journalist who witnessed N-word used in Fifth Estate meeting calls for broader change at CBC,"When Dexter Brown began working at the CBC four years ago, it felt like home.

""I felt like I was giving back to Canada because it is Canada's public broadcaster,"" he said in an interview. ""It holds a special place in my heart.""

Brown lives near the CBC's downtown Toronto headquarters and still walks by sometimes, but he no longer goes inside.

He now works at another network.

Today, Brown is calling for change at the public broadcaster, as he speaks out for the first time about his experience as a Black man hearing two colleagues at The Fifth Estate use the N-word in an editorial discussion in April 2019.

He is coming forward as issues of race have shifted to the forefront of societal debate, with the lack of diversity in the media under the microscope and recent revelations that the N-word was used on two occasions by CBC host Wendy Mesley during editorial meetings at The Weekly.

Brown was working as an associate producer with The Fifth Estate, CBC's flagship investigative program, when the word was repeatedly used in a documentary about racial issues in the American South screened for more than 30 people, including the show's leadership as well as CBC staff not affiliated with the show.

Two longtime Fifth Estate employees then used the word in a staff discussion afterward — either quoting people in the item that had just been shown or when discussing its contents.

""I couldn't have ever imagined that would have happened, where somebody would have thought that it was OK to use that word,"" Brown said.

""Disappointed with what took place — and a bit embarrassed as well, being the only Black person in the room. It's quite surreal.""

According to Brown and multiple accounts from other people who were in the room, no one was admonished for the use of the N-word at the time, and there was no discussion about it being used.

Months-long investigation

After Brown later raised it with the show's executive producer and a human resources manager, the public broadcaster called in an external law firm to do an investigation that ran for months.

When the investigation was complete, Brown says, he was provided few details of how the matter was resolved.

""It was a bit of a let-down. I was hoping to get a better understanding of what happened, why it happened,"" he said.

Several senior CBC executives approached for comment declined interview requests, offering instead a written statement through head of public affairs Chuck Thompson, who cited confidentiality agreements.

""While we will not be commenting on details pertaining to this matter, we can confirm there was a comprehensive investigation conducted by a third-party investigator,"" Thompson wrote in an emailed statement.

""We can also confirm there were findings from the investigation, and corrective actions were taken.""

The public broadcaster says it has recently expanded its diversity and inclusion goals. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)

Thompson did not answer specific questions about the cost of the probe, what ""corrective actions"" were taken and against whom, and how the public broadcaster would handle a similar incident if it happened today.

""We continue to learn as to how we can better engage with our employees when these matters arise,"" Thompson wrote.

""We have a strong senior leadership team in place, and there is a renewed commitment to ensuring CBC is a safe, inclusive and supportive workplace.""

The public broadcaster recently expanded its diversity and inclusion goals, announcing that by fiscal 2021-22, ""half of all new hires for executive and senior management positions will be Indigenous people, visible minorities or people with disabilities.""

The corporation said retention and promotion rates for people from these three groups will be doubled, and unconscious bias training will be mandatory for leaders.

Screening of documentary

The use of the N-word Brown witnessed took place April 16, 2019, as The Fifth Estate team was preparing for a new season under newly appointed executive producer Catherine Legge. The discussion involved looking at different styles of documentaries.

The editorial team screened one titled Murder in Mississippi that was part of a series called Love and Hate Crime.

It told the story of three white teenagers who killed a Black man in a racially motivated hit-and-run.

Brown says there was no warning to staff before the screening about the racial slur they would hear. The N-word was used a dozen times in the documentary — in 911 calls, in trial testimony and by a white woman who insisted it had no racial connotation.

Near the end of the documentary, the white mother of a young woman convicted of a hate crime met with the Black judge who presided over her daughter's trial. After that conversation, the mother agreed she should no longer use the N-word.

Sources who were present at the screening say two Fifth Estate employees — host Gillian Findlay and editor Loretta Hicks — used the N-word in staff discussions about the documentary immediately following the screening.

Witnesses in the room at the time described Findlay as quoting a person from the documentary that had just been shown to the group.

In an emailed statement, Findlay said she didn't recall saying the N-word but is sorry if she did.

""Over the course of 15 months, I have revisited that day many times,"" the statement said. ""I have never had — and do not now have — a recollection of repeating the documentary's use of the word myself. If, however, my memory is wrong, and I did quote someone from the film using the word, I apologize. It should not have happened.

Gillian Findlay is one of the hosts of The Fifth Estate. (CBC)

""I agree with the CBC there is much to learn from how this incident was handled at the time and since. The questions you pose are fair. But like all who were interviewed by the CBC's third-party investigator, I was obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement that continues to prohibit me from discussing this with anyone, including colleagues.""

Hicks — who sources say used the N-word in the ensuing discussion — declined comment.

Multiple CBC employees who were in the room at the time described the scene, on the condition they not be identified because they feared reprisal from leadership at the public broadcaster.

They said no concerns were raised about the use of the word.

""I just remember the silence — like, the nothingness that followed,"" one said.

Another was also surprised at the lack of reaction in the room.

""I have been in these rooms where people have come to the point of cursing, and they have been admonished for it,"" they said.

""And this was someone using a racial slur, and nobody said anything.""

They described it as ""shameful"" that in a room full of veteran journalists employed by the public broadcaster no one spoke up.

A third person described their difficulty comprehending what had happened.

""I'm looking around for other people's reaction — like, are you as shocked as I am? And it was almost like people felt like they couldn't be shocked.""

Brown and the others say the top leaders in the room included Legge and the CBC's senior director of investigative journalism, Marie Caloz.

In a brief telephone conversation a week ago, Legge said she was preparing a statement for this story. But she did not respond to follow-up calls and messages, and no statement was provided prior to this report.

Legge is no longer with The Fifth Estate. She was appointed executive producer of original video with CBC News two months ago, overseeing the creation of current affairs and documentary content.

Caloz declined comment, saying she is ""restricted by a non-disclosure agreement"" and there is nothing more she can add beyond what CBC has shared.

Then-CBC News editor-in-chief Jennifer McGuire confirmed there was a complaint made connected to The Fifth Estate, and it was investigated by an external expert.

""Beyond this, I am not at liberty to discuss further as it pertains to HR files,"" said McGuire, who left the public broadcaster earlier this year.

Asked why non-disclosure agreements were required for this process — and whether people could be released from their agreements so they could speak freely — CBC head of public affairs Chuck Thompson pointed to the third-party investigator.

""Confidentiality is the underlying principle of any investigation, and while we give third-party investigators high-level guidelines, they operate independently of us and use their own methods of investigation,"" Thompson wrote in an emailed statement.

""Investigations include non-disclosure agreements, and these agreements ensure integrity of the process and protect all participants. It is not in the purview of the CBC to enable a breach of the confidentiality agreement.""

'We know the CBC can do better'

Nadia Stewart, the executive director of the Canadian Association of Black Journalists, remembers receiving a call from Brown the night of April 16, 2019. They discussed the documentary screening and other concerns Brown had about the workplace environment at The Fifth Estate.

""By the time he got to the end of telling me the story, he was in tears,"" Stewart said in an interview.

""I've never forgotten the conversation. I think the impact on him was just so evident, and the hurt that he had felt in that moment. You could hear it in his voice.""

Stewart says people have to assume a certain level of personal responsibility when engaging in a conversation where words are used that they know are very sensitive for some of the other people in the room.

""If it's used in the documentary, I understand that. But I don't believe that it justifies repeating,"" she said.

Stewart drew a parallel with conversations about violence. One doesn't need to re-enact a violent act when telling a story about one, she said.

She says companies have a responsibility in such situations to act quickly — not just to take disciplinary action but also to ensure that the person who suffered the pain is handled with care.

""We know the CBC can do better,"" Stewart said. ""And in this instance, definitely should have done better.""

Brown asked to be transferred

The day after the screening, Brown raised what had transpired with Legge. He received emails from show leadership expressing support, but says he did not get any details about a plan to deal with the situation going forward.

Nearly two weeks later, he wrote a CBC human resources manager, asking to be transferred off the show, citing the screening where the N-word was used and other concerns about the work environment at The Fifth Estate. Brown says he was offered other work by the CBC, but he wasn't satisfied with the options. So he decided to stay.

CBC ultimately tapped an outside labour law firm to launch a probe.

Brown says he was informed of the findings in early October and was told that two people were confirmed to have said the word. But he says he was not given the specifics of any actions that had been taken and was not provided with anything in writing.

""I didn't really want an investigation to begin with, but if you're going to put me through that for so many months, I mean, there should be a payoff, like learn something,"" Brown said.

""There should be payoff where I know what actions CBC was going to take just to make sure that something like that wouldn't happen again.""

In February, his contract with The Fifth Estate expired. He briefly worked elsewhere within the CBC before taking a job as a producer at CTV News, where he remains today.

During his time with The Fifth Estate, email records show that he received positive feedback from supervisors about his work.

Meanwhile, the union representing employees of the public broadcaster said it, too, would like to see the investigator's final report, which the CBC has not shared with the union.

""While we cannot speak about individual cases, we have made it clear to CBC that addressing anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism is a priority,"" Canadian Media Guild national president Carmel Smyth said in an emailed statement.

""The corporation must act. This is long overdue.""

Smyth did not respond to follow-up questions about what steps the union took to support Brown.

Mesley news was 'tipping point'

Brown said it was hearing last month about the use of the N-word at another CBC editorial meeting that prompted him to come forward to tell his story now.

""I think what the tipping point was, was hearing about what happened at The Weekly with Wendy Mesley,"" he said.

""To know that another journalist of colour had to face something kind of similar to what I faced. That was really tough.""

Brown said he hopes going public with his experience will help make things better for others in the future.

""So, to hear that story — to hear about stories in other newsrooms across Canada — I really hope that by talking, there's some positive change. That's really what I want. I just want some positive change,"" he said.

""And again, it's not just for me. It's not just for, you know, other people of colour who work at CBC and other news organizations. It's for the Canadian public, because I feel like Canadians are really missing out on a lot of stories because they don't have people of colour working in their newsrooms.""

He says some Black journalists could get frustrated and simply leave the business entirely.

He would like to see a change in the newsroom culture and a healthier work environment.

""I really want the full picture, a full understanding of the world around us. And I don't think we're getting that if we're losing journalists of colour in newsrooms. Not only that, making them feel uncomfortable, making them feel not welcome, not heard.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dexter-brown-fifth-estate-n-word-investigation-1.5658885?cmp=rss,news,canada,
25270,2020-07-22 16:41,Transgender pastor fired after coming out to her Mississauga church,"Junia ""June"" Joplin knew she was taking a risk when she came out as a transgender woman to her congregation — now after that leap of faith, she's learned she'll no longer be the lead pastor at her Mississauga church.

Last month, Joplin shared what she called her ""big, risky truth"" with her parishioners in an sermon delivered via Zoom.

""If I never work another day in the church again for the rest of my life, I'll know that I've done what I was called to do,"" she told CBC News at the time.

Now, Joplin's contract with the Lorne Park Baptist Church has been terminated after after a vote by 111 members of the congregation — 52 per cent in favour of termination.

""The Church has journeyed for the past month through a process of attempting to discern God's will resulting from June's announcement of June 14, 2020 that she is a transgender woman,"" the church said Wednesday in a statement to CBC News.

""After a month of prayerful discernment and discussions between June and the congregation, it was determined, for theological reasons, that it is not in God's will that June remain as our pastor.""

A long journey

Joplin, who grew up in rural North Carolina with her parents, two sisters, a brother — first began preaching at a local Baptist Church when she was just 11. She knew she wanted to become a minister, she told CBC News last month, but she was also grappling with questions about her gender identity.

In 2014, Joplin moved to Mississauga to become the Lorne Park Baptist Church's lead pastor. She began coming out to people in her life in 2018, first to her spouse, then to a few close friends — a year later deciding to tell her siblings and then her sons.

Last month, she made the decision to tell her congregation.

""I want you to hear me when I tell you that I'm not just supposed to be a pastor. I'm supposed to be a woman. My friends, my family, my name is Junia. You can call me June. I'm a transgender woman and my pronouns are she and her,"" Joplin said during her online sermon last month.

After Joplin's coming out sermon, the church told CBC News the congregation and leadership were surprised by the announcement, and ""expressed love"" for her identity as a woman.

Although she's disappointed to learn her contract was terminated, Joplin said Wednesday she remains grateful for the response she received from them immediately after coming as transgender.

A bad day as my real self is better than a good day when I was repressed. - Junia Joplin

""I am grateful to them and I want to acknowledge just how kind and respectful at least their language has been,"" Joplin said.

""Nobody intentionally misgendered me or did anything that was intentionally disrespectful so there has been a grace and kindness through the entire process.""

Coming out something Joplin could not 'forego'

Despite the church's decision, Joplin says that coming out was something she could not ""forego.""

""That was a necessity at this stage in my transitional journey, so the decision to come out was something that absolutely had to happen,"" Joplin said.

""I feel free in a way that I never did before I came out in transition,"" she said.

""I was saying to a friend the other day, 'A bad day as my real self is better than a good day when I was repressed and out of touch with myself and living under this cloud that I didn't understand.'""

""I feel free in a way that I never did before I came out in transition,"" Joplin told CBC Toronto in an interview via Zoom. (Jasmin Seputis/CBC)

Despite the outpouring of support she's received since coming out, Joplin says the past five weeks have not been easy.

Still, she has no regrets.

""I wanted to connect with people who, either in my congregation or elsewhere, needed to hear important truths spoken about who they are or who the people near them are,"" Joplin said.

For now, Joplin says she would love to continue working in congregational ministry ""in some form or fashion.""

""I don't know what that will look like, I don't know where that will be — but I don't have to know that yet.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/transgender-pastor-fired-1.5657371?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
25266,2020-07-22 16:35,"Trump sending federal law enforcement agents to Chicago, Albuquerque","U.S. President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr announced Wednesday that federal agents will surge into Chicago and Albuquerque, N.M., to help combat rising crime, expanding the administration's intervention in local enforcement as Trump runs for re-election under a ""law-and-order"" mantle.

Hundreds of federal agents have already been sent to Kansas City, Mo., to help quell a record rise in violence after the shooting death of a young boy there. Sending federal agents to help localities is not uncommon. Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence.

Usually the Justice Department sends agents under its own umbrella, such as from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the Drug Enforcement Administration. But this surge effort will include at least 100 Department of Homeland Security Investigations officers working in the region who generally conduct drug-trafficking and child exploitation investigations.

DHS officers have already been dispatched to Portland, Ore., and other localities to protect federal property and monuments as Trump has lambasted efforts by protesters to knock down Confederate statues.

Trump has linked the growing violence in the streets with protests over racial injustice, though criminal justice experts say the spike defies easy explanation, pointing to the unprecedented moment the country is living through — a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans, historic unemployment, stay-at-home orders, a mass reckoning over race and police brutality, intense stress and even the weather. And compared with other years, crime is down overall.

WATCH | Officials demand troops out of Portland, Trump threatens more force:

State and local officials in Oregon are demanding federal authorities, brought in to break up protests, get out of Portland. But U.S. President Donald Trump wants to expand his law-and-order plans to other cities, blaming Democrats for the ongoing protests and unrest. 2:04

Local authorities have complained that the surges in federal agents have only exacerbated tensions on the streets.

The decision to dispatch agents to American cities is playing out at a hyper-politicized moment when Trump is trying to show he is a ""law-and-order"" president and painting Democratic-led cities as out of control.

With less than four months to go before November's election, Trump has been serving up dire warnings that the violence would worsen if his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, is elected president, as he tries to win over voters who could be swayed by that message.

But civil unrest in Portland only escalated after federal agents there were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause.

Local leaders reject federal presence

The spike in crime has hit hard in some cities with resources already stretched thin from the pandemic. But the move to send in federal forces was initially rejected by local leaders.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot later said she and other local officials had spoken with federal authorities and come to an understanding.

""I've been very clear that we welcome actual partnership,"" the Democratic mayor said Tuesday after speaking with federal officials.

""But we do not welcome dictatorship. We do not welcome authoritarianism, and we do not welcome unconstitutional arrest and detainment of our residents. That is something I will not tolerate.""

Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump’s troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents. —@chicagosmayor

In New Mexico, meanwhile, Democratic elected officials were cautioning Trump against any possible plans to send federal agents to the state, with U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich calling on Bernalillo County Sheriff Manny Gonzales, who will be at the White House on Wednesday, to resign.

""Instead of collaborating with the Albuquerque Police Department, the sheriff is inviting the president's stormtroopers into Albuquerque,"" the Democratic senator said in a statement.

But federal gun crimes generally carry much stiffer penalties than state crimes — and larger-scale federal investigations that can cross state lines tend to make a big impact.

'Agents won't be patrolling the streets'

The Justice Department will reimburse Chicago $3.5 million US for local law enforcement's work on the federal task force. Through a separate federal fund, Chicago received $9.3 million to hire 75 new officers.

Two dozen agents will be sent to Albuquerque, and the administration made available $1.5 million in funding for the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department for five new deputies and $9.4 million for 40 new Albuquerque officers.

In Kansas City, the top federal prosecutor said any agents involved in an operation to reduce violent crime in the area will be clearly identifiable when making arrests, unlike what has been seen in Portland.

WATCH | Tear gas fired at demonstrators during a protest in Portland:

Protests over racism and police brutality have been going on in Portland, Ore., almost daily for over 50 days since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. The Trump administration has deployed federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security to crack down on the protests. 4:22

""These agents won't be patrolling the streets,"" U.S. Attorney Timothy Garrison said. ""They won't replace or usurp the authority of local officers.""

Operation Legend — named after four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month — was announced on July 8. The first arrest came earlier this week.

Garrison has said that the additional 225 federal agents from the FBI, DEA, ATF and the U.S. Marshals Service join 400 agents already working and living in the Kansas City area.

The Trump administration is facing growing pushback in Portland. Multiple lawsuits have been filed questioning the federal government's authority to use broad policing powers in cities. One suit filed Tuesday argues federal agents are violating protesters' 10th Amendment rights by engaging in police activities designated to local and state governments.

Oregon's attorney general sued last week, asking a judge to block federal agents' actions. The state argued that masked agents had arrested people on the streets without probable cause and far from the U.S. courthouse, which has become a target of vandalism.

Federal authorities, however, said state and local officials had been unwilling to work with them to stop the vandalism and violence against federal officers and the U.S. courthouse.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-operation-legend-federal-authorities-american-cities-1.5659139?cmp=rss,news,world,
25268,2020-07-22 16:07,"Indy 500 attendance limited to 25 per cent capacity, masks mandatory","The Indianapolis 500 will limit fan attendance, implement strict testing, social distancing and mask requirements, and lift the local broadcast blackout for just the second time in nearly seven decades when the postponed race is run next month at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

Speedway officials released a detailed 88-page plan Wednesday for conducting the 104th edition of the race in the age of the coronavirus. The first race under new track owner Roger Penske was scheduled for its usual May date on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, but the virus outbreak caused it to be rescheduled for Aug. 23.

Penske Entertainment chief executive Mark Miles acknowledged ""everything will be different about this year's race.""

Capacity will be limited to 25 per cent — about 87,500 fans — at the massive speedway, and tickets will be distributed to allow proper social distancing among groups. Even a crowd that size would make it the largest sporting event in North America and perhaps anywhere since the pandemic shutdown began in March.

Most concessions will consist of prepacked food. Fans will have their temperature checked upon entry and receive hand sanitizer and a mask, which they will be required to wear when they are not eating or drinking. New signage and video boards will be posted to provide guidance throughout the speedway.

""In terms of the plan itself, it is approved. We have a green flag and we expect to do the race,"" Miles said. ""We think it's important to have a race, have this race, to set an example for how people can come together under proper procedures.""

The Indianapolis 500 has run continuously since 1911 with just two breaks for World War I and World War II. While the speedway does not announce official attendance figures, the sprawling facility with its infield lake and golf course can hold about 300,000 people, surpassing Ascot Racecourse as the largest sports facility in the world.

The speedway has prohibited live television coverage of the race locally since 1950, fearing it would cut into ticket sales and attendance. The only time besides this year the blackout was lifted was for the 100th running in 2016, when officials announced that all grandstand and general admission tickets had sold out.

Mask requirement polarizing issue across U.S.

""Under these circumstances,"" Miles said on a conference call, ""we thought it was important this year.""

Many of the Indy 500 safeguards are familiar to IndyCar, which has conducted six races since resuming its season, including the last two weekends at Road America and Iowa Speedway, where a limit number of fans were allowed.

""I thought they did a great job,"" Miles said. ""Fans wanted to be there. Fans did their part. There were chalked circles in grass areas and people sat in those circles with who they came with. And we've got a couple more races before we get to Indianapolis. We think we get better all the time at it.""

The biggest sticking point among fans could be the mask requirement, which has become a polarizing — and deeply political — issue across the country. But the mayor of Indianapolis joined several cities and states in issuing an executive order that mandates them in public spaces earlier this month, and Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Doug Boles hopes that six weeks of the requirement will give fans the time to become accustomed to wearing them.

""I know how passionate our customers are for the 500 and I know they want this to happen, and I know they're going to participate,"" Boles said. ""A lot of it's going to feel the same. It is still our place to celebrate every year.""

IndyCar is off this weekend before returning Aug. 9 on the road course at Mid-Ohio. Teams will then head to Indianapolis to begin practice and qualifying, both of which will be open to the public with the same safeguards as race day.

Fans with access to Gasoline Alley will still be allowed to wander among the garages, though the amount will be capped at a much smaller number. But many popular events, such as concerts, the red carpet and the Last Row Party, have been cancelled. The activities on Saturday, including Legends Day and the 500 Festival Parade, also have been cancelled or will transition to digital platforms to give organizers time to prep the facility for Sunday.

""The organizers have done a tremendous job of identifying those environments that have been high-risk and they have been cancelled,"" said Dr. Ed Racht, chief medical officer for Global Medical Response, who helped speedway officials formulate their plan.

""The temperature screening component identifies potentially anybody who wouldn't be allowed in. Face coverings make a difference, and I think culturally, we're all realizing that is an effective way to minimize transmission.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/indy-500-fan-capacity-1.5659198?cmp=rss,sports,,
25251,2020-07-22 15:55,"Quebec provincial police say Martin Carpentier killed daughters, then himself","Two young girls found dead near Saint-Apollinaire, Que., on July 11 were killed by their father just hours after he took them out for an ice cream cone and didn't return, triggering the longest Amber Alert in Quebec history, provincial police said Wednesday.

Sûreté du Québec Chief Insp. Guy Lapointe confirmed that a body discovered Monday evening was that of Martin Carpentier, the girls' father.

Lapointe said the police investigation revealed that Carpentier's daughters, six-year-old Romy and 11-year-old Norah, died due to blunt force trauma and that police are calling it a ""double murder.""

He said the conclusion that Carpentier killed his daughters ""puts an end to the criminal investigation,"" since the police have determined that no one else was involved in the crime. Now, he said, the coroner's office will take over the investigation.

Lapointe said he didn't want to engage in speculation or theories about what might have motivated the killings.

""The reality is, the suspect has died and there are some things we will never really know,"" he said.

But Lapointe said a crash on Highway 20 on the evening of July 8 seems to have been a ""tipping point"" for Carpentier.

Up until that moment, he said, Carpentier showed no signs of violent behaviour.

Lapointe said initially, after speaking with the girls' family, police had no reason to suspect Carpentier would harm his children. He said this led to a delay in sending out an Amber Alert.

The accident investigation team said the crash did not appear to have been deliberate but was in fact an accident. But Carpentier left his cellphone in the car and fled the scene with his daughters.

Police say he then broke into a trailer for some supplies, and shortly after, he killed the girls in the woods.

Lapointe said police believe the three deaths occurred within 12 hours of the crash and that all three were dead by the morning of July 9.

Initial findings led police to conclude Carpentier died by suicide.

His body was found 5.5 kilometres from the initial crash site, but it took police more than 10 days to locate it.

Lapointe said dense tree cover in the woods and the fact that the three were already dead and couldn't be found using heat-sensing cameras made the search difficult.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sq-update-martin-carpentier-daughters-1.5658615?cmp=rss,news,canada,montreal
25256,2020-07-22 15:42,"Chicago funeral home shooting was gang-related, police say","A shooting outside a funeral home in Chicago's South Side that left 15 people injured was part of an ongoing conflict involving the gang of a young man being mourned and a rival gang, police said Wednesday as the federal government said it planned to send more agents to the city to combat a spike in gun violence.

Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said the man whose funeral people were attending had been killed in a drive-by shooting last week and that he was killed in retaliation for a previous shooting.

Mourners were outside a funeral home in the Englewood neighbourhood Tuesday when three people pulled up in a stolen car and two of them opened fire. People at the funeral returned fire, the car crashed a short time later and the three occupants fled on foot, police said.

Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said at least 60 shell casings were recovered following the shooting, which happened despite police having two squad cars outside the funeral home — a precaution the department regularly takes at funerals involving those linked to gangs — as well as a tactical team deployed to the neighborhood.

""We had intelligence that the deceased was killed in a drive-by shooting ... and there was a gang connection and we deployed our resources accordingly,"" he told reporters at a news conference Wednesday.

Police said the 15 people who were injured were all adults, two were in critical condition and the other 13 are expected to recover.

Police have said one person of interest was taken in for questioning Tuesday night, but declined to provide further details on Wednesday.

Federal agents being deployed

The shooting comes as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is planning to deploy dozens of federal agents to Chicago to deal with an uptick in violent crime in the city.

Neither Brown nor Mayor Lori Lightfoot commented at the news conference on the planned increased federal presence in the city.

After threatening to sue if U.S. President Donald Trump acted without her permission, Lightfoot noted on Tuesday that the city would be working with federal agents to fight crime.

She said Chicago will receive resources that will plug into existing federal agencies already working with the city, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Lightfoot has been skeptical of federal agents being sent to Chicago due to the controversy in Portland, Ore., where the Trump administration sent federal officers after weeks of protests there over police brutality and racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor have expressed anger with the presence of the federal agents, saying that the city's protests had started to ease just as the federal agents started taking action.

Trump has framed such protests in the nation's large cities as a failure by ""liberal Democrats"" who run them.

He also praised the officers' actions and said he was looking to send agents to other cities, pointing to rising gun violence in Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, where more than 63 people were shot, 12 fatally, over the weekend.

'We thought it was a war'

On Tuesday, those injured outside the funeral home included 10 women between the ages of 21 and 65, including one woman who was shot in the chest.

Police said a man also suffered gunshot wounds in the chest, arm and forearm, and two other men, 32 and 22, were shot in the hand.

Arnita Geder and Kenneth Hughes said they heard gunshots while in their home watching television, adding that they came outside to find bodies that were shot up and ""laying everywhere.""

""We thought it was a war out here,"" Geder told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""It's ridiculous all the shooting that's going on out here, it really has to stop.""

Tuesday's shooting highlighted what Brown said are hundreds of gang conflicts that occur everywhere in the city involving 117,000 gang members, dozens of gangs and hundreds of gang factions.

25261,2020-07-22 15:35,Raptors' Terence Davis says focus should remain on Breonna Taylor's killers,"Terence Davis is using his platform for things bigger than basketball.

In Wednesday's media availability, the Toronto Raptors rookie's message was brief and direct. He answered his one question — about basketball — with a message about Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old who was shot and killed by police officers on March 13.

""A lot of the guys, we're united right now. We're just keeping the focus on Breonna Taylor's killers. That's what I want to keep the focus on this week,"" the 23-year-old said.

""It's nothing against you guys -- and I can answer all of you guys' questions post-game or any time after we're playing – but right now I just want to keep the focus on what's really going on in the world. There's a lot of social injustice going on and I just want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing and using my platform, as well as other athletes, to just continue with this thing, man.""

Davis' thoughts came two days after Sixers forward Tobias Harris used his media availability to send the same message.

""We all stand united. We don't all have to be on the same team but we're still united in the league. I just want to keep the focus on Breonna Taylor's killers and just keep that going, man, because it's still going on in the world,"" said Davis.

He then said goodbye to reporters, stood up and walked away.

The fight for 'justice and equality'

Both the NBA and WNBA are using their restarts after the COVID-19 hiatus to amplify social and racial justice messages.

Raptors veteran forward Serge Ibaka echoed Davis's sentiments.

The 30-year-old was asked how he's keeping himself busy in the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World.

""Right now with what is going on around the world, I'm trying to focus more on that …,"" Ibaka said. ""Justice and equality, that is what we are trying to fight for now.""

Ibaka, who held a virtual talent show on Instagram early in the coronavirus lockdown, said he was hoping to create a show that would allow NBA players the opportunity to share their thoughts on Black Lives Matter issues.

""I'm sure you know, but we want justice for Breonna Taylor and that is something we are trying to fight for, any player in the league, any player on my team, we try to fight for,"" he said. ""I think she deserves justice so my focus right now is on that.""

The Congolese big man said the racial unrest in the U.S. is going to be felt in all parts of the world.

""If we can fight for change here, that change is going to affect everywhere,"" he said. ""Like you saw when people started protesting in the United States, and then guess what? It led to people out in the streets protesting [everywhere].

'Bree should be with us'

""The fact that we are protesting here is bigger than just here. It is going to affect everywhere.""

CJ McCollum, a shooting guard for the Portland Trail Blazers, told reporters that he and some other NBA players spoke with Taylor's mother on a conference call recently.

Taylor's mom Tamika told TMZ she appreciates how NBA and WNBA players are keeping a spotlight on her daughter's death.

""Everyone raising their voices for justice are what keeps this family going each day,"" Tamika Palmer said. ""What is being done by the NBA and the WNBA is amazing. Now, it's time for the attorney general to listen, to charge everyone responsible for Bree's murder and to get overdue justice.

""Bree should be with us. The world was a better place with her.""

25253,2020-07-22 15:34,Terrorism charges laid against Calgary man accused of helping ISIS in Syria,"Alberta's RCMP Integrated National Enforcement Team has laid terrorism charges against a Calgary man following an investigation that lasted seven years.

Hussein Sobhe Borhot, 34, of Calgary has been charged with three counts of participation in the activity of a terrorist group, and one count of commission of an offence for a terrorist group, RCMP said in a release.

Between May 2013 and June 2014, Borhot travelled to Syria, where he contributed to the activities of ISIS and received training from the terror group, according to investigators.

Police say he also knowingly committed the offence of kidnapping.

Following a judicial hearing, Borhot is being held in custody and will appear in Calgary provincial court on Friday.

RCMP said the investigation is ongoing and could result in further arrests or charges, and that no further details will be released.

CBC News reported in March 2017 that Borhot was among several men with Calgary connections whose names were discovered on ISIS documents that appeared to be application forms to join the terrorist organization.

On the paperwork, Borhot listed his profession as ""plumber"" and noted his level of ""Shariah"" — the legal code of Islam, based on the Qur'an — was basic.

25277,2020-07-22 15:34,Terrorism charges laid against Calgary man accused of helping ISIS in Syria,"Alberta's RCMP Integrated National Enforcement Team has laid terrorism charges against a Calgary man following an investigation that lasted seven years.

Hussein Sobhe Borhot, 34, of Calgary has been charged with three counts of participation in the activity of a terrorist group, and one count of commission of an offence for a terrorist group, RCMP said in a release.

Between May 2013 and June 2014, Borhot travelled to Syria, where he contributed to the activities of ISIS and received training from the terror group, according to investigators.

Police say he also knowingly committed the offence of kidnapping.

These type of investigations are particularly complex, RCMP spokesperson Fraser Logan told CBC.

""The investigation is still ongoing, there are hopes that there could be further charges or arrests … against other individuals,"" Logan said. ""I'm not too sure if there are going to be further charges against Borhot.""

The three counts of participation in activity of a terrorist group include Borhot ""entering Syria, enlisting, participating, receiving training, committing terrorist activities and kidnapping for the benefit of, or at the direction of the Islamic state,"" Logan said.

Accused to appear in court Friday

The charges, including the kidnapping charge, are based on his activities in Syria. None of the charges have been proven in court.

Borhot is currently in custody and will appear July 24 at the Calgary Provincial Court.

CBC News reported in March 2017 that Borhot was among several men with Calgary connections whose names were discovered on ISIS documents that appeared to be application forms to join the terrorist organization.

On the paperwork, Borhot listed his profession as ""plumber"" and noted his level of ""Shariah"" — the legal code of Islam, based on the Qur'an — was basic.

In November 2017, CBC News reported that agents from Canada's federal counterterror security force had questioned a Calgary man, Yacine Meziane, regarding the whereabouts of Borhot.

Difficult investigations

Amarnath Amarasingam, an assistant professor in the School of Religion at Queen's University who has studied radicalization, said it's likely police received some new information before laying these charges.

""Collecting information in Syria that could hold up in a Canadian court of law is very difficult,"" Amarasingam told CBC. ""To find evidence that he joined a listed terrorism agency from that period would have been enormously difficult for the RCMP to prove in court. So I think that's probably why it took so long.

""This added charge that they threw in there today about kidnapping likely suggests some new information that they received from another source, maybe from another country, that they now feel confident enough to use in court and charge him with those previous offences.""

ISIS is the militant group that took over territory in Iraq and Syria and implemented a harsh form of Islamic law.

ISIS fighters are known for graphic videos documenting beheadings of journalists and aid workers. They're accused by the United Nations of crimes against humanity for carrying out mass executions, abducting women and girls to use as sex slaves and using child soldiers.

'Long game'

Amarasingam said the length of the investigation shows the RCMP are serious about following up on Canadians who return from fighting in Syria.

""It is indicative that they're playing the long game, that even after five, six years they're willing to bring charges against an individual who by all accounts that I've spoken to in Calgary, has basically moved on with his life, is not currently radicalized, is kind of just living his life with his family, just going to work and so on,"" Amarasingam said.

""To now charge him five years later shows that the RCMP is very much committed to following these cases through to the end ... If they can find the right kind of evidence, we might see more charge for other people as well.""

Amarasingam said there is a movement among some researchers and community workers to help returning fighters get rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.

Individuals who have been deradicalized, especially if they're critical of the groups that they joined, could be used to ""talk to young people about the dangers of these kinds of groups,"" he said. ""So, there is this other movement afoot that's kind of moving away from arrest and imprisonment, particularly if you don't have the evidence to actually be successful in court.""

When Borhot left Syria, his stated reason was that he planned to go ""join the brothers in Lebanon,"" but he actually returned to Canada in the spring of 2014.

""It's important to keep in mind as well that this individual hasn't done anything since he returned to Canada. There's no evidence of radicalization, there's no evidence of plotting, as far as we can tell there's no evidence that he's endangering public safety over the last five years,"" Amarasingam said.

""I do think it's a bit, maybe unfair is the wrong word, but a bit strange to charge someone six years after the fact, especially when he didn't join the organization as we know it today. It will be interesting to see what kind of evidence comes forward in the case because I think this kidnapping charge is very interesting. As more details emerge, it might become clear that he did a lot more in Syria than we understand, but we'll have to wait and see.""

The fate of former Canadian ISIS militants and their families has been the subject of heated debate on the floor of the House of Commons in the past, with the Conservatives accusing the Liberals of welcoming home jihadist fighters.

25257,2020-07-22 15:32,'Emotional and happy': Some Inuit reflect on Edmonton CFL team's decision to change name,"Some Inuit say they were in tears, while others say they'll ""believe it when [they] see it,"" after Edmonton Football Club's decision on Tuesday to discontinue the use of a controversial word in the team's name.

""It's always been a different foreign word to me,"" said Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, an Inuk filmmaker known for her work on Inuit life and culture.

""When non-Inuit would use the word Eskimo to me, it felt like they were being deliberately confrontational — like they're dominant, they're in control.""

Some Inuit have said the word — which some historians believe is an Algonquin term for ""eaters of raw meat"" — is derogatory. The Canadian Football League club said it has begun an engagement process on a new name and will use Edmonton Football Team and EE Football team in the meantime.

We had a good ol' celebration. We also had some tears. - Inuksuk Mackay, Inuk performer

Arnaquq-Baril recalled a conversation she had at the dinner table with her mother about this topic.

""For my mother, and for others, it [brings] up all kinds of awful memories,"" she said. ""When a non-Inuk would come to the door of the house, we would often rush and hide the raw food out of shame, because they were so bullied and teased for being eaters of raw meat.""

Arnaquq-Baril said she has mixed feelings about Tuesday's announcement.

""On one hand, I think I'll believe it when I see it, and on the other, feeling a little emotional and happy,"" she said.

Inuk performer Inuksuk Mackay has spoken out about the team's name in the past, saying it's oppressive.

On Tuesday, sitting with her family in their B.C. home, Mackay said the news was a victory for Inuit.

""We had a good ol' celebration. We also had some tears,"" said Mackay.

'We're multitaskers'

In the past, some Inuit have said they weren't insulted by the word, and voiced their support for the moniker . They said people should focus rather on the territory's housing crisis, cost of food and suicide rates.

This February, Nunavut cabinet minister Lorne Kusugak said he was proud to hear that the Edmonton team chose to keep their name following consultations.

""Anybody else who thinks it's an offence just, settle down. Take a Valium. Don't be so sensitive,"" Kusugak said at the time.

Mackay said she doesn't think pushing for a name change takes away from Nunavut's pressing issues.

""We're multitaskers. We can handle more than one thing on our plate at a time,"" she said. ""And this huge change is going to demonstrate that Inuit are to be taken seriously when we're asking for change to happen.""

Mackay said she hopes more company names, mascots and logos objectifying groups of people will follow suit and change.

""There's no need for that anymore,"" Mackay said.

The Edmonton team's board chair, Janice Agrios, says the decision to change the team's name is part of a bigger societal change.

""It became clear to us that there were more and more people who were not comfortable with the use of the name,"" the she told the CBC on Tuesday morning.

Toronto had considered playing at its spring training facility in Dunedin, Fla., or at Sahlen Field, the home of the Jays' triple-A affiliate in Buffalo, N.Y. However, surging coronavirus cases in Florida and a lack of space and lighting concerns in Buffalo raised doubts about the potential sites.

25254,2020-07-22 15:14,Scientists struggling to understand how to contain silent spread of coronavirus before it's too late,"One of the great mysteries of the novel coronavirus is how quickly it rocketed around the world.

It first flared in central China and within three months was on every continent but Antarctica, shutting down daily life for millions. Behind the rapid spread was something that initially caught scientists off guard, baffled health authorities and undermined early containment efforts: The virus could be spread by seemingly healthy people.

As workers return to offices, children prepare to go back to school and those desperate for normalcy again visit malls and restaurants, the emerging science points to a menacing reality: If people who appear healthy can transmit the illness, it may be impossible to contain.

""It can be a killer and then 40 per cent of people don't even know they have it,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, Calif.

Researchers have exposed the frightening likelihood of silent spread of the virus by asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers. But how major a role seemingly healthy people play in swelling the ranks of those infected remains unanswered — and at the top of the scientific agenda.

The small but mighty coronavirus can unlock a human cell, set up shop and mass produce tens of thousands of copies of itself in a single day. Virus levels skyrocket before the first cough, if one ever arrives. And astonishing to scientists, an estimated four in 10 infected people never have symptoms.

San Diego Metropolitan Transit System worker Chache Rolison wears a Fitbit while on the job on July 9. The device is part of a Scripps Research DETECT study to monitor a person's heart rate and allow participants to record symptoms like fever or coughing to share with scientists, in an attempt to see if they can spot COVID-19. (Gregory Bull/The Associated Press)

The slyness of the virus remains on the minds of many scientists as they watch societies reopen, wondering what happens if silent spreaders aren't detected until it's too late.

Travellers with no coughs can slip past airport screens. Workers without fevers won't be caught by temperature checks. People who don't feel tired and achy will attend business meetings.

And outbreaks could begin anew.

Data 'was shocking'

As early as January, there were signs people could harbour the virus without showing symptoms. Still, many scientists remained unconvinced.

The concept of people unwittingly spreading disease has never been an easy one to grasp, from the polio epidemic of the mid-20th-century United States to the spread of HIV decades later.

As COVID-19 emerged, health officials believed it would be like other coronaviruses and that people were most infectious when showing symptoms like a cough and fever, with transmission rare otherwise.

""We were thinking this thing is going to look like SARS: a long incubation period and no transmission during the incubation period,"" said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a disease modeller at the University of Texas at Austin.

Behind the scenes, scientists like Meyers were sharing their alarming finding with health officials. By scouring the websites of Chinese health departments, Meyers and her team found more than 50 cases between Jan. 21 and Feb. 8 where the person who brought the virus home didn't develop symptoms until after infecting a family member.

""When we looked at the data, we said, 'Oh no, this can't be true,""' she said. ""It was shocking.""

Cruise ship intrigued researchers

Rebecca Frasure, who contracted the virus while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, sat in bed in Japan in late February, frustrated to be kept hospitalized even though she didn't have any symptoms.

""I'm perfectly healthy except having this virus in my body,"" Frasure said.

Without widespread and frequent testing, it's impossible to know how many people without symptoms might carry it. The Diamond Princess, which idled in the Port of Yokohama while the virus exploded onboard, enticed researchers.

A mathematical model built by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine aimed at estimating how many infected people without symptoms were being missed indicated that a startling three-quarters of infected people on the Princess were asymptomatic.

In Washington state, similar clues emerged for Dr. Jeff Duchin as a team of investigators examined the Life Care nursing home — the site of the first major U.S. cluster of cases — and found health-care workers were spreading the virus to other elder-care facilities. They believed at least some were working while infected but before feeling symptoms.

In March, more than half the residents at another nursing home who tested positive didn't have symptoms.

All that underscored the need to shift gears and acknowledge the virus couldn't be totally stopped.

""This disease is going to be extremely hard to control,"" Duchin recalled thinking.

Some scientists remain doubtful

The nose and mouth are convenient entryways for the coronavirus. Once inside, the virus commandeers a cell's machinery to copy itself while fending off the body's immune defences. Virus levels skyrocket in the upper airway, all without symptoms early on. Many scientists believe that during these days, people can spread virus just by talking, breathing or touching surfaces.

In the truly asymptomatic, the immune system wins the battle before they ever feel sick.

As it became clearer that healthy people could spread the virus, U.S. health authorities opted not to wait for scientific certainty. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people wear masks.

Days later, Chinese researchers published a paper saying patients are most infectious two to three days before developing symptoms. Evidence continues to accumulate, and the CDC now estimates 40 per cent of transmission is occurring before people feel sick.

Still, doubt remains among scientists, most notably among the World Health Organization, which has discounted the importance of asymptomatic infection — though it recently began to acknowledge that possibility and advised people to wear masks.

U.S. health officials blame China for delays in sharing information on silent spread. But Topol said the U.S. could have mounted its own testing program with viral genome sequencing.

That's no small matter: Gaining scientific clarity earlier would have saved lives.

""We've been slow on everything in the United States,"" Topol said. ""And I have to say it's shameful.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-silent-spread-scientists-1.5658639?cmp=rss,news,health,
25242,2020-07-22 14:52,Kim Kardashian asks for compassion amid husband Kanye West's erratic behaviour,"Kim Kardashian on Wednesday asked for compassion and empathy for her rapper husband Kanye West's struggles with bi-polar disorder that have led to a series of rambling public remarks on subjects ranging from politics to his marriage.

Kardashian's statement on her Instagram stories account was her first public comment on weeks of interviews, public appearances and Twitter comments by West that have raised concern about the Grammy-winning singer's mental health.

""As many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder,"" she wrote, calling him a ""brilliant but complicated person.""

Kardashian did not mention West's stated plan to run for the White House in the November 2020 election. West held a rally in South Carolina at the weekend under his self-styled Birthday Party banner but has not outlined any coherent political policies.

""Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions,"" Kardashian wrote.

Kardashian's comments followed another late-night series of tweets from West, including one where he said he was trying to divorce Kardashian. His tweet was swiftly deleted. The couple married in 2014 and have four children.

Erratic tweets

Earlier this week, West tweeted that his family was trying to get him committed to a psychiatric institution.

West announced he had bi-polar disorder in 2018 and has in the past lamented that he feels medication stifles his creativity. He was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in 2016.

Bi-polar disorder is a form of mental illness characterized by unusual mood swings between extreme energy and activity and depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. It can be treated with a combination of medication and therapy.

Kardashian, a cosmetics businesswoman who first found fame on the TV reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians said she and her family were trying to get help for West, and spoke about the stigma and misunderstandings around mental health.

""Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behaviour know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor,"" she said.

25260,2020-07-22 13:56,Neepawa hockey team changing name in response to calls to scrap offensive monikers,"The Neepawa junior men's hockey team is changing its name.

The board of directors for the team in Manitoba's junior hockey league made the decision to change its name at a meeting Tuesday night, head coach and general manager Ken Pearson told CBC News.

""We're just trying to get ahead of the curve here, and, you know, be ahead of the game,"" Pearson said Wednesday.

Multiple factors went into the decision to change the name, including trends in the wider sporting world, as well as an expected regulatory change by Hockey Manitoba that would ban offensive names, said Pearson.

""[The board wants] to begin a new era but still, you know, being able to continue on the history and tradition of the hockey club,"" he said.

Pearson's history with the team dates back to its creation in 1989, when he started as a player at the age of 16. The team's current name, the Neepawa Natives, dates back to the early 1960s when the local senior men's intermediate hockey team adopted the name, he said.

With that history in mind, Pearson said he and others in the community feel some ""disappointment"" at the prospect of changing the name.

""But, you know, there's also some, I think, some excitement about it as well,"" he said. ""I understand that in our ever-changing world that we need to keep up with the times and we don't want to get left behind. So we need to look forward and embrace the change as a team and I'm looking forward to being the guy that helps lead that.""

There is currently no process for making the name change, which is expected to happen in time for the 2021-2022 season. Local leaders and business people will come together to formulate a plan, said Pearson.

The decision to change the Neepawa team's name comes as another western Manitoba hockey team, based in Morden, is considering a change to its name.

First Nations organizations, as well as Morden's mayor, have called for the team to change its name, which is considered a slur against Indigenous people.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/neepawa-hockey-team-changing-name-1.5658914?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba
25238,2020-07-22 13:52,Sailor sounds alarm after Americans approved to join St. John's ship without isolating,"Sailors aboard an offshore supply vessel based in St. John's are worried for their safety after the provincial government approved four American technicians to join the ship without self-isolating upon entering the province.

Several crew members on the Maersk Nexus have opposed the company's decision to bring in the workers from Oil States Industries to join them as the ship heads to Quebec for repairs next month.

Oil States Industries has several bases in Texas, where COVID-19 is surging at a rate rivalled only by Florida.

""Under normal circumstances this is a normal procedure, but COVID-19 has changed everything,"" the crew wrote in an email to the federal government from the ship's email address. ""We feel this is a health issue to us and our families.""

In response to questions from CBC News, a Maersk executive said the Americans will arrive in St. John's around Aug. 11, and proceed straight to their hotel where they will be tested for the virus. The test must come back negative before they can board the ship, which is due to depart for a shipyard in Les Méchins, Que., on Aug. 12.

They love to talk about safety until it really comes down to it. - Maersk crewmember

""These four persons would have also been tested prior to leaving the U.S.,"" said Francois-Xavier Morency, the managing director of Maersk's operations in Canada. ""An exemption to quarantine from the N.L. government has been received for these four persons.""

Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, signed an exemption order May 29, allowing a wide range of professions to skip the isolation period when coming to the province. Included in the order are crew on any vessel.

When not working, they must self-isolate.

The provincial order is in line with a federal exemption to the Canadian-American border closure, which allows essential workers to cross over without the need for isolation.

A new case of COVID-19 arose in Prince Edward Island earlier this month from a health-care worker who travelled from outside the Atlantic bubble with a similar arrangement. He tested negative upon entering the province, as per regulations, but then tested positive a week later, after working seven shifts at a Charlottetown hospital.

Premier Dwight Ball said last week more than 9,900 people have received exemptions to enter Newfoundland and Labrador, but it's not known how many of them were also exempt from the standard isolation orders.

The provincial government says it hasn't kept a tally of how many people have been exempt from isolation and where they came from. Aside from workers deemed essential, every traveller from outside Atlantic Canada has to spend 14 days quarantined in the province before they can go out in public.

The ship's refit was mandated by Transport Canada before the pandemic. Maersk could have applied to the federal agency to delay the repair work, but opted instead to schedule it for August.

Exemptions undercut safety, says crew member

A concerned crew member spoke to CBC News on the condition of anonymity, as they fear they could lose their job for speaking out.

They said there is no way to keep a distance of two metres between each worker on the ship, and are concerned what could happen if one of the Texans walks aboard the ship with COVID-19.

Some of the St. John's crew members have vulnerable family members, or have their own underlying conditions that could make COVID-19 a fatal infection.

Maersk has a thorough COVID-19 safety plan, but the crew member said the company undercut any commitments it had to worker safety when it sought exemptions to isolation orders for the Texan technicians.

""They love to talk about safety until it really comes down to it,"" the crew member said.

Europeans will meet the ship in Quebec

Internal emails provided to CBC show Maersk initially expected there to be 55 people on board the boat once it made the three-day voyage from St. John's to Les Méchins.

A later manifest showed 35 workers, including 10 from the Norweigian company Kongsberg, who are set to join the team in Quebec.

Maersk says those European workers will be working on repairs at the shipyard, but will not be staying on board the ship.

""The yard protocols will be followed, including temperature checks of all persons entering the yard,"" a spokesperson for Maersk wrote in a response to CBC. ""All persons entering the yard must also complete a COVID protocol form for the yard. There are no cases in this part of Quebec.""

There will be a crew change partway through the month-long refit, and Maersk is also seeking exemptions to self-isolation orders for the Newfoundland and Labrador workers aboard the ship when they return to the province from Quebec.

That's where the whistleblower is worried the worst could happen. The province has become accustomed to life without cases, after spending the majority of the last three months without COVID-19 anywhere in Newfoundland and Labrador.

With restrictions loosened and people living freer daily lives, the crew member worries his ship could be the source of an outbreak.

25267,2020-07-22 13:37,"Tour boats at Niagara Falls show contrast between U.S., Canadian approach to COVID-19","The two boats tell very different stories.

Aboard Maid of the Mist VII, passengers in blue ponchos appear to fill the top deck and wrap around the lower level as it sails on the American side of Niagara Falls. The passing Canadian-run Hornblower is all but empty with just a handful of people wrapped in red, huddled in pairs near the railing.

Images of the boats cruising past each other below the iconic landmark have caused discussion to swell on social media, with many suggesting the stark contrast in passengers is symbolic of the difference in the Canadian and American approaches to COVID-19.

It's a contrast Hornblower Niagara Cruises vice-president Mory DiMaurizio said he's noticed too.

""When you look at what's happening in Ontario or Canada, there's clearly a difference,"" he said.

""That's clearly evident in terms of what's happening with respect to the number of infections and recoveries and deaths proportionate to the population base of our two countries.""

Although the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across the United States, Canada has largely fared better, helped by strict physical distancing measures and mask requirements in several jurisdictions.

At the famous waterfalls on the U.S.-Canadian border, Canadian ferries are limited to just six passengers per boat, out of a 700-person capacity. But on the U.S. side, the ferries are operating at 50 per cent capacity, according to Maid of the Mist boat tours.

""We actually took a picture of the [American] boat,"" said Julie Pronovost, visiting from Quebec with her family on Tuesday. ""I don't find that it's very safe to be on a boat like that. It's much better here.""

A spokesperson for the Maid of the Mist did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company's website said it was following the guidance of New York State public health officials.

The boats contain markers to keep visitors spaced out, and face coverings are compulsory, among other safety changes, it said.

DiMaurizio said his cruise line is also following health precautions, including temperature checks and mandatory masks for everyone on board.

They're currently able to transport 10 people, but that number also includes four crew members needed to make the trip.

""The visuals are pretty ridiculous. You've got this giant vessel with six people on it, but that's what's permitted,"" he explained.

""Of course, when we look across the way at our competitor, we would love to have the ability to carry 30 per cent or 50 per cent, but to do so in a safe way is equally important, or even more important.""

Slowly turning up the volume

Tourists at the falls on Tuesday said they felt much safer with the six-person per boat limit.

""I'm glad I'm in Canada,"" said Amanda Barnes of Brampton, Ont. ""You can see why the pandemic is raging in the United States and not in Canada when you look at the difference between the boats.""

The United States reported 57,777 new COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday, compared with Canada's 786. Since the outbreak began, the U.S. has reported around 118 coronavirus cases per 10,000 residents, while Canada has around 30.

DiMaurizio compared Ontario's approach to COVID-19 to ""turning the volume up slowly.""

The latest increase in volume is set to happen Friday, when Niagara moves into Stage 3 of the province's reopening plan.

Under those guidelines, Hornblower will be able to boost its number of passengers to 100, DiMaurizio said, but he expects the visual comparison between the two cruise companies will still be stark.

Those 100 people will still be ""on a vessel that holds 700 passengers so it's still going to look really skinny … on that vessel,"" he said, pointing out that space leaves ample room for physical distancing.

""It's still going to look pretty empty. But we'll take it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/maid-of-the-mist-niagara-falls-hornblower-covid-1.5658620?cmp=rss,news,canada,hamilton
25241,2020-07-22 13:13,Amber Heard testifies Johnny Depp threw liquor bottles at her 'like grenades',"Amber Heard alleged in a British court on Wednesday that ex-husband Johnny Depp threw ""30 or so bottles"" at her as if they were ""grenades or bombs"" during a frenzied, drunken assault in Australia in March 2015 that also saw him accidentally sever part of his finger.

Taking the witness box for a third day at the High Court in London during Depp's libel case against a British tabloid, Heard, an actor, refuted his allegation that it was she who lost her temper and that she had injured him.

Heard has described her stay in Australia with Depp as akin to a ""three-day hostage situation,"" during which Depp was ""completely out of his mind and out of control"" following a binge on drugs and alcohol. Heard has said that she feared for her life while at the rented property on Australia's Gold Coast during a visit while Depp was filming the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film.

The incident is central to The Sun labelling Depp a ""wife-beater"" in an April 2018 article. The Sun's defence relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as the rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet.

Depp, 57, is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. He denies abusing Heard and claims she was the aggressor during their tempestuous relationship. He was present once again to hear Heard's testimony.

Depp threw bottles 'like grenades,' Heard says

Depp's lawyer, Eleanor Laws, said Heard had worked herself ""into a rage"" during her stay in Australia and that she had a habit of just ""losing it.""

Heard, 34, said she got ""angry at times but not into a rage that would cause me to throw anything at him.""

She acknowledged that she broke one bottle during their second evening together in Australia, testifying that it happened as they argued about the scale of Depp's drinking.

""I regret I did that,"" said Heard, who also claimed that Depp often credited her for saving him by trying to get him clean and sober.

After she smashed the bottle, Heard alleges that Depp, fueled by alcohol and drugs, started throwing bottles, which she said were full enough that they broke a window behind her.

""He started picking them up one by one and throwing them like grenades or bombs,"" she said. ""One after the other after the other, in my direction, and I felt glass breaking behind me.""

She said he threw all the bottles that were within reach, bar one ""celebratory magnum-sized bottle of wine.""

""I would be shocked if Johnny remembers any of this himself, but I was there,"" Heard said.

Heard also denied severing the tip of Depp's finger during the alleged bottle-throwing or putting out a cigarette on his cheek during the incident. She said it was something that Depp used to do to himself.

""I was standing right in front of him,"" Heard said. ""It was deliberate.""

She said Depp ""screamed"" at her that he couldn't feel the pain while stubbing the cigarette on his cheek. She testified that Depp was high on cocaine and MDMA at the time, as well as drunk.

Heard testifies makeup covered bruises

Depp's lawyer, Laws, also accused Heard of lying about an alleged incident of domestic violence in Los Angeles in December 2015, which Heard has described in written testimony as ""one of the worst and most violent nights"" of the couple's relationship.

In her testimony, Heard alleged that Depp slapped her and pulled out clumps of her hair while dragging her through their apartment, then repeatedly punched her in the head.

Laws said medical notes made by a nurse, Erin Boerum, who saw Heard shortly after the alleged incident, didn't note any bruises, just bleeding on her lip. The lawyer suggested the bleeding resulted from Heard biting her lip.

""Of course not,"" Heard responded. ""I had two black eyes, a broken nose, a broken rib ... I had bruises all over my body.""

Depp's lawyer also played a short clip of Heard's appearance on James Corden's The Late Late Show the day after the alleged 2015 incident. Laws said the footage showed no injuries on Heard.

""I had tons of injuries,"" Heard said, adding that makeup had covered them up.

Melanie Inglessis, Heard's makeup artist, told the court that she camouflaged the injuries with concealer ahead of the model-actor's appearance on the show. Inglessis confirmed that she attended the London court hearing involuntarily via video link from Los Angeles.

During the first nine days of case testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who backed his version of events.

In his testimony, Depp said he was the one being abused by Heard and that she had a history of being violent against him.

In written testimony released to the court, Heard said that at various times during her and Depp's relationship she endured ""punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking.""

She said some incidents were ""so severe"" she was ""afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far."" She said he blamed his actions on ""a self-created third party"" that he referred to as ""the monster.""

Depp and Heard met on the set of the film The Rum Diary, released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.

Thursday is expected to be Heard's final day of testimony.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/johnny-depp-amber-heard-libel-trial-1.5658768?cmp=rss,news,entertainment,
25239,2020-07-22 13:08,Quebec provincial police to give update on Martin Carpentier case,"Quebec provincial police will hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. today, nearly two days after finding a body believed to be that of missing 44-year-old Martin Carpentier behind a garage near Saint-Apollinaire, Que.

Carpentier had been sought in connection with the deaths of his two daughters.

On Twitter Monday night, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) said that ""everything suggests"" the body is Carpentier's, but they were still waiting for autopsy results to confirm that.

Initial findings led police to conclude Carpentier died by suicide.

Carpentier had been missing since July 8, when he was last seen with his daughters, six-year-old Romy and 11-year-old Norah.

The bodies of the two girls were found three days later in a densely forested area near Saint-Apollinaire.

Questions surrounding case remain

The events leading up to the three deaths are still shrouded in mystery. Many are hoping SQ Chief Insp. Guy Lapointe will clear up that mystery this afternoon.

The SQ has not revealed how the two girls died.

Throughout their search for Carpentier, the SQ repeatedly stated that they hoped to find him alive because he was the only one who could explain what happened.

The night Carpentier and his daughters went missing, they were last spotted at a convenience store in Lévis.

Just an hour after that, Carpentier's vehicle crashed about five kilometres west of the store, on Highway 20. Police found the car badly damaged and abandoned, with a cellphone inside.

It is still not known if the girls were in the car at the time of the crash.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sq-update-martin-carpentier-news-conference-1.5658615?cmp=rss,news,canada,montreal

On July 22, 1990, Catholique, who is from Łútselk'e, was looking for a ride on Highway 3 near Behchokǫ̀, and seen walking along the highway toward Yellowknife. The 15-year-old was not seen again.

In a news release on Wednesday, RCMP said its Historical Case Unit is still investigating the case, ""trying to gather information as to what happened at the intersection of Highway 3 and Behchokǫ̀ Access Road.""

RCMP say they're ""hoping for a breakthrough,"" and it's still an open, active investigation.

""Any tips from the public could potentially help us shed some light as to what happened 30 years ago and bring closure to her family,"" said Cpl. Mike Lewis, in the statement.

Last year, Catholique's case was featured on a national missing person page, and her profile is also part of the Missing Kids database. N.W.T. RCMP also produced a Crime Stoppers video re-enacting her disappearance, which was released in 2017 on YouTube.

Watch the re-enactment of the disappearance:

The RCMP statement says the unit's investigators are ""constantly probing"" for other avenues to follow in the case.

Though previous family members, including Catholique's father and an aunt, have expressed frustration about RCMP's efforts in the case, RCMP say they've kept in touch with another of her aunts since the beginning of the investigation.

""I have been diligently involved with this file from day one, and spoke with multiple investigators,"" Lorraine Catholique said in the news release.

""I have seen the size of the file, and it is not a simple task to investigate and try to resolve Charlene's disappearance.""

She asked anyone with information to come forward.

Catholique has been described as Indigenous, with brown eyes and black hair, approximately five feet five inches tall, 126 pounds, with a slender build.

RCMP say anyone with information on her disappearance can call RCMP at 867-669-1111, Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or text: ""nwtnutips"" plus your message to 274637.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/charlene-catholique-missing-30-years-rcmp-1.5658774?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
25288,2020-07-22 12:48,Social bubble confusion contributing to increase in COVID-19 cases,"As the number of new cases of COVID-19 continue to climb in Ottawa, an epidemiologist worries forgotten messaging around what constitutes a social circle is partly to blame.

Ottawa Public Health recorded 43 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday, the highest single-day total since early May. More than half of those cases were in people under age 30.

Social circles — also known as social bubbles —used to be front and centre in the conversation about COVID-19, said Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. ""But once things started opening up, that way of thinking and talking has seemed to have vanished.""

He said one's social bubble should be an exclusive, closed group of friends and family, up to a maximum of 10 people. They are the people you can hug, socialize with, and be intimate, without having to physically distance or wear a mask.

""It's like being in a self-contained space colony or a spaceship going to another star, where these are the only people you are going to be with, and interact with, and share germs with,"" he said.

Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa, says messaging around social circles has been lost as Ontario has begun to reopen its economy. (Supplied by Raywat Deonandan)

He's worried people are conflating rules around social gatherings with social circles. Under Ontario's Stage 3 reopening rules, gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed indoors, while up to 100 are allowed outdoors. Yet, people are still required to physically distance if they aren't part of the same social circle.

As businesses continue to reopen, maintaining a social bubble is more important than ever, said Deonandan.

""Failure to do so is why we have this this trend toward increasing cases.""

Ottawa trend raising red flag

According to Ottawa Public Health, the rise in COVID-19 cases isn't related to either Stage 2 or Stage 3 of the province's reopening, but people engaging in higher-risk activities. One activity in particular — large indoor gatherings — is especially concerning, said Dr. Brent Moloughney, Ottawa's associate medical officer of health. People, mostly in younger demographics, have been socializing with others outside their social bubble, without physically distancing or wearing masks, he said.

Part of the problem stemmed from confusion around social bubbles and what they mean.

""People, you know, can potentially say 'we'll have that group of 10 and that group of 10 and each of my other 10s will have their own groups of 10 and of course that's just a recipe for transmission,"" he said.

Brent Moloughney, Ottawa’s associate medical officer of health, says the rise in COVID-19 cases is not necessarily due to businesses reopening but to indoor gatherings among younger residents. 0:55

Similar trend across Canada

It's not just Ontario that's seen a surge in COVID-19 cases recently. Provinces across the country are showing an uptick in cases in people under the age of 30.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, believes the reopening of bars may have given people the impression the situation is more relaxed and that they don't have to take as many precautions.

""It creates a bit of a mindset that 'hey, things are going back to normal. Even though I'm not going, the bars and restaurants are open, so what the heck. Why can't I have a party with my friends at home?',"" he told Power & Politics.

He said the federal government is looking at ways to educate younger people on the importance of physical distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask.

25234,2020-07-22 12:35,"Canada's asylum agreement with the U.S. infringes on Charter, says federal court","A federal court judge says the Safe Third Country Agreement — Canada's asylum agreement with the United States — infringes upon the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and is giving the federal government six months to respond.

Justice Ann Marie McDonald said the agreement — which stops people from entering either Canada or the U.S. at official Canada-U.S. border crossings and asking for asylum — violates the section of the Charter guaranteeing ""the right to life, liberty and security of the person""

The case was brought forward by the Canadian Council of Refugees, Amnesty International, the Canadian Council of Churches and a number of individual litigants who argued that by returning ineligible refugee claimants to the U.S., Canada exposes them to risks — including detention and eventual deportation to countries where they could face harm.

""The applicants have provided significant evidence of the risks and challenges faced by STCA ineligible claimants when they are returned to the U.S.,"" McDonald wrote.

""The evidence establishes that the conduct of Canadian officials in applying the provisions of the STCA will provoke certain, and known, reactions by U.S. officials. In my view, the risk of detention for the sake of 'administrative' compliance with the provisions of the STCA cannot be justified.""

The Safe Third Country Agreement says refugee claimants are required to request refugee protection in the first safe country they arrive in — meaning Canadian border officials would send back to the U.S. any would-be refugee claimants arriving at an official border crossing into Canada.The agreement has come under intense scrutiny since U.S. President Donald Trump's administration began tightening asylum rules.

Advocates have argued the Trump administration's actions mean the U.S. is no longer a safe harbour for those seeking asylum.

McDonald said to allow time for Parliament to respond, she is suspending her declaration of invalidity for a period of six months.

25235,2020-07-22 12:26,British PM under fire in House of Commons after Russian meddling report,"Britain's government faced heated questions on national security Wednesday after a damning intelligence committee report on Russian meddling concluded the U.K. should examine allegations of interference in the Brexit referendum.

The report concluded that Russia sees Britain as one of its top intelligence targets, adding that Moscow's attempts to influence the U.K. are the ""new normal"" and successive governments have welcomed Russian oligarchs with open arms.

The fallout from the report from Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee dominated the agenda on the final day in the House of Commons before the summer break, with lawmakers demanding to know whether the U.K. had done enough to face the threat posed by Moscow.

Opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer challenged Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the Commons, suggesting he sat on the report despite its dire warnings of the threat to national security.

""The report was very clear, that until recently the government badly underestimated the Russian threat and the response it required,"" Starmer said. ""It's still playing catch-up. The government's taken its eye off the ball — arguably it wasn't even on the pitch. After this government has been in power for 10 years, how does the government explain that?""

Though Johnson insisted new laws are coming in connection with espionage, theft of intellectual property and sanctions, he sidestepped on the notion put forward by the report's authors that nothing was done to investigate whether Russia had interfered in the referendum.

The real problem, Johnson insisted, is that some lawmakers still object to the outcome of the 2016 referendum — namely, voters' decision to leave the EU.

That group of remainers, he said, are now interested in trying to suggest Moscow was responsible for Brexit.

""That's what this is all about,"" Johnson said. ""The people of this country didn't vote to leave the EU because of pressure from Russia or Russian interference, they voted because they wanted to take back control of our money, our trade policy and our laws.""

25236,2020-07-22 12:22,Silent spread of virus keeps scientists grasping for clues,"One of the great mysteries of the new coronavirus is how quickly it rocketed around the world.

It first flared in central China and, within three months, was on every continent but Antarctica, shutting down daily life for millions. Behind the rapid spread was something that initially caught scientists off guard, baffled health authorities and undermined early containment efforts — the virus could be spread by seemingly healthy people.

As workers return to offices, children prepare to return to schools and those desperate for normalcy again visit malls and restaurants, the emerging science points to a menacing reality: If people who appear healthy can transmit the illness, it may be impossible to contain.

""It can be a killer and then 40 per cent of people don't even know they have it,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, Calif.

Researchers have exposed the frightening likelihood of silent spread of the virus by asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers. But how major a role seemingly healthy people play in swelling the ranks of those infected remains unanswered — and at the top of the scientific agenda.

The small but mighty coronavirus can unlock a human cell, set up shop and mass produce tens of thousands of copies of itself in a single day. Virus levels skyrocket before the first cough, if one ever arrives. And astonishing to scientists, an estimated 4 in 10 infected people don't ever have symptoms.

Rev. Jane Pauw poses for a portrait in Seattle. (Elaine Thompson/Associated Press)

The slyness of the virus remains on the minds of many scientists as they watch societies reopen, wondering what happens if silent spreaders aren't detected until it's too late.

Travellers with no coughs can slip past airport screens. Workers without fevers won't be caught by temperature checks. People who don't feel tired and achy will attend business meetings.

And outbreaks could begin anew.

First hints

As early as January, there were signs people could harbour the virus without showing symptoms. Still, many scientists remained unconvinced.

The concept of people unwittingly spreading disease has never been an easy one to grasp, from the polio epidemic of mid-century America to the spread of HIV decades later.

As COVID-19 emerged, health officials believed it would be like other coronaviruses and that people were most infectious when showing symptoms like cough and fever, with transmission rare otherwise.

""We were thinking this thing is going to look like SARS: a long incubation period and no transmission during the incubation period,"" said Lauren Ancel Meyers, a disease modeller at the University of Texas at Austin.

Behind the scenes, scientists like Meyers were sharing their alarming finding with health officials. By scouring the websites of Chinese health departments, Meyers and her team found more than 50 cases between Jan. 21 and Feb. 8 where the person who brought the virus home didn't develop symptoms until after infecting a family member.

""When we looked at the data, we said, 'Oh no, this can't be true,""' Meyers said. ""It was shocking.""

Cruise ship clues

Rebecca Frasure, who contracted the virus while aboard the Diamond Princess cruise, sat in bed in Japan in late February, frustrated to be kept hospitalized even though she didn't have any symptoms.

""I'm perfectly healthy except having this virus in my body,"" Frasure said.

Without widespread and frequent testing, it's impossible to know how many people without symptoms might carry it. The Diamond Princess, which idled in the Port of Yokohama while the virus exploded onboard, enticed researchers.

The device is part of a Scripps Research DETECT study to monitor a person's heart rate and allow participants to record symptoms like fever or coughing to share with scientists, in an attempt to see if they can spot COVID-19. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press)

A mathematical model built by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine aimed at estimating how many infected people without symptoms were being missed indicated that a startling three-quarters of infected people on the Princess were asymptomatic.

In Washington state, similar clues emerged for Dr. Jeff Duchin as a team of investigators examined the Life Care nursing home — the site of the first major U.S. cluster of cases — and found health care workers were spreading the virus to other elder care facilities. They believed at least some were working while infected but before feeling symptoms.

In March, more than half the residents at another nursing home who tested positive didn't have symptoms.

All that underscored the need to shift gears and acknowledge the virus couldn't be totally stopped.

""This disease is going to be extremely hard to control,"" Duchin recalled thinking.

Unanswered questions

The nose and mouth are convenient entryways for the coronavirus. Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell's machinery to copy itself, while fending off the body's immune defences. Virus levels skyrocket in the upper airway, all without symptoms early on. Many scientists believe that, during these days, people can spread virus just by talking, breathing or touching surfaces.

In the truly asymptomatic, the immune system wins the battle before they ever feel sick.

As it became clearer that healthy people could spread the virus, U.S. health authorities opted not to wait for scientific certainty. In early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people wear masks.

Days later, Chinese researchers published a paper saying patients are most infectious two to three days before developing symptoms. Evidence continues to accumulate, and the CDC now estimates 40 per cent of transmission is occurring before people feel sick.

Still, doubt remains among scientists, most notably among the World Health Organization, which has discounted the importance of asymptomatic infection, though it recently began to acknowledge that possibility and advised people to wear masks.

U.S. health officials blame China for delays in sharing information on silent spread. But Topol contends the U.S. could have mounted its own testing program with viral genome sequencing.

That's no small matter: Gaining scientific clarity earlier would have saved lives.

""We've been slow on everything in the United States,"" Topol said. ""And I have to say it's shameful.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-silent-spread-1.5658639?cmp=rss,news,health,
25228,2020-07-22 11:46,GG's secretary promises to improve work environment following allegations of verbal abuse at Rideau Hall,"Gov. Gen. Julie Payette's secretary has sent a memo to Rideau Hall employees promising to improve the working environment following reports of a toxic climate within the Governor General's office.

The memo from Payette's secretary and longtime friend, Assunta Di Lorenzo, thanks staff for the work they've done so far.

""I want you to know that I, along with the Governor General and the entire management team, am deeply committed to fostering a healthy work environment,"" says the memo, obtained by CBC News.

""Please rest assured that the well-being of our employees remains our priority.""

The email came just hours after a CBC News story reported that Payette, according to sources, verbally harassed employees to the point where some were reduced to tears or left the office altogether. Di Lorenzo also is accused of harassing employees and calling some ""lazy"" and ""incompetent.""

""This has gone from being one of the most collegial and enjoyable work environments for many of the staff to being a house of horrors,"" said one government source. ""It's bullying and harassment at its worst.""

CBC spoke to a dozen sources with direct knowledge of the office environment during Payette's mandate. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared they could lose their jobs or their careers could suffer.

Concerns about accountability

Di Lorenzo's memo, sent out Tuesday evening, doesn't deny the allegations but calls the story ""troubling, to say the least.""

The email goes on to tell staff they can talk to their manager, their director, human resources or the ombudsman if they have complaints.

""We are here to listen and to take action in order to keep improving our work environment,"" the memo said.

However, sources who worked at Rideau Hall said the harassment claims should raise questions about oversight and accountability at Rideau Hall.

Employees can complain to the HR office, but the complaints go to Di Lorenzo, who reports to the Governor General.

Like other federal employees, the Governor General's staff members can talk to an ombudsman with Public Services Procurement Canada, but it's not part of the ombudsman's mandate to register complaints or launch investigations. At most, the ombudsman can raise issues to the most senior person within the department — in this case, Di Lorenzo.

NDP calls for review

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said all workplaces need to be safe and called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to look into the allegations against Payette.

There has been an exodus of employees from Gov. Gen. Julie Payette’s Rideau Hall office because of a culture of bullying and harassment, CBC News has learned. 2:15

""I think the first step would be to follow up on complaints and then there could be a thorough investigation of these. And if there were enough evidence to warrant suspending the Governor General from her duties, then that would be assessed at that point,"" he told a news conference Wednesday morning.

""There is a lack of transparency. There is a lack of clear protocol, which leads to a confusing and uncertain situation for employees.""

The Prime Minister's Office said all Canadians have to work in a ""healthy, respectful and safe environment,"" but referred CBC's questions to Rideau Hall ahead of Tuesday's story.

""Our government is committed to ensuring that all federally-regulated workplaces are free from harassment of any kind,"" said PMO press secretary Ann-Clara Vaillancourt.

25231,2020-07-22 11:37,"Disciplinary charges dropped against Thunder Bay, Ont. police officer in altercation with Indigenous teen","A Thunder Bay, Ont. police officer caught on video striking an Indigenous teen has had Police Services Act charges against her dropped after an internal process, but the force won't disclose any disciplinary measures that were taken.

Const. Courtney Clair was charged with two counts of unlawful or unnecessary exercise of authority last year, after the Dec. 1, 2018 incident, but those charges were officially withdrawn last week.

The incident, which was captured on video and subsequently widely shared on social media, showed a teen girl on a stretcher being struck by the officer, later identified as Clair.

Thunder Bay Police Service spokesperson Chris Adams said the decision to withdraw the charges was made following an exhaustive review by the force's prosecutor.

""The Chief's complaint against the officer has been resolved through an internal disciplinary process which involves corrective steps to address the officer's conduct during the 2018 incident,"" Adams said in a written statement.

Adams said the issue is now an internal employment matter and no further statement would be made on the case, including the nature of the internal process or the corrective steps.

Under Ontario's Police Services Act, disciplinary proceedings are typically open to the public with a designated hearing officer responsible for determining whether the allegations have been proven and to make a decision on any disciplinary action.

Alvin Fiddler, the grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation which represents 49 First Nations communities in northern Ontario, previously called for an independent investigation with its results made public.

In the video, the officer is heard yelling, ""That's enough,"" before appearing to hit the teen in the face.

The officer later yelled, ""Do not spit on me, you do not spit on me,"" while appearing to forcefully push down on the person on the stretcher.

25227,2020-07-22 11:25,Finance Minister Bill Morneau set to testify on deal with WE Charity,"Finance Minister Bill Morneau will appear today before a House of Commons committee that is probing a cancelled agreement for WE Charity to run a student-volunteer program.

Morneau has apologized for not recusing himself from the cabinet discussions and the vote on the agreement, given his daughters have ties to the organization.

The committee hearing begins at noon. Morneau is scheduled to take questions alongside assistant deputy minister Michelle Kovacevic at 2 p.m. CBC News will stream the meeting live.

Morneau will be the latest cabinet minister to be grilled over the aborted deal that would have seen WE receive more than $43.5 million to oversee a program with a budget of up to $912 million.

Morneau, like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is being investigated by the federal ethics watchdog for possible violations of conflict of interest rules.

On Tuesday, Clerk of the Privy Council Ian Shugart said he couldn't see not having the finance minister and prime minister involved in discussions about a program as big in scope and price as the Canada Student Service Grant program.

However, Canada's top bureaucrat said he wasn't offering a judgment on whether the two should have recused themselves.

The program proposed paying students up to $5,000 toward education costs based on the number of hours they volunteer.

MPs on the finance committee will also hear from Jesse Brown, publisher of the media organization Canadaland, which has reported on the finances of the WE Charity and its for-profit sister organization, ME to WE.

Other individuals appearing before the committee include researcher and writer Vivian Krause; Rahul Singh, executive director of Global Medic; and Paulette Senior, president and CEO of the Canadian Women's Foundation.

Union head disputes assertion that only WE could administer program

The Liberals have said the non-partisan public service recommended going with WE as it was the only organization in the country that could quickly begin to administer such a large program.

In early July, WE handed control of the program back to the government in response to the controversy about its connections to Trudeau. The organization has paid speaking fees to his mother and brother.

On Tuesday, the head of the Public Service Alliance of Canada told the finance committee that public servants could have delivered the program, while lawyer Joshua Mandryk raised concerns about paying students less than the minimum wage and calling it volunteering.

Shugart said a program will roll out, but it will offer much less in the way of support services to students as a consequence of the public service having to deliver the program.

The Canadian Federation of Students is calling on the government to abandon the program and push all the money into an emergency benefit for out-of-work students.

The group warns students may be unable to accumulate enough hours to receive grants because it's almost August and there is no clarity on when the program will launch.

""Students have waited for this program to roll out since April and now they're told they have to wait even longer,"" national chair Sofia Descalzi said in a statement.

""This is unacceptable.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/finance-committee-morneau-we-charity-1.5658627?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25240,2020-07-22 11:07,Telescope snaps photograph of 2 planets orbiting baby sun,"For the first time, a telescope has captured a family portrait of another solar system with not just one, but two planets posing directly for the cameras while orbiting a star like our sun.

This baby sun and its two giant gas planets are fairly close by galactic standards at 300 light-years away.

The snapshot — released Wednesday — was taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert.

What makes this group shot so appealing is it's a ""very young version of our own sun,"" said study leader Alexander Bohn of Leiden University in the Netherlands.

Bohn said he was ""extremely excited"" about the discovery. ""This is the first time astronomers were able to capture such a shot,"" he said in an email.

The observations can help scientists better understand the evolution of our own solar system.

Watch | View of the orbit of two exoplanets around TYC 8998-760-1, a sun-like star:

Astronomers typically confirm worlds around other stars by observing brief but periodic dimming of the starlight, indicating an orbiting planet. Such indirect observations have identified thousands of planets in our Milky Way galaxy.

It's much harder and less common for a telescope to directly observe these so-called exoplanets. To directly spot two of them around the same star is even rarer. Only two multi-planet solar systems have been spotted using the direct method, both with stars quite different than our sun, according to the observatory.

Of the 4,183 exoplanets confirmed to date, only 48 of them have been directly imaged — just one per cent, according to NASA statistics.

Direct imaging provides humanity's best chance to detect life outside our solar system, if it exists, Bohn said. By observing light from the planets themselves, the atmospheres can be analyzed for molecules and elements that might suggest life.

Star system snapshot

The work, published in Wednesday's Astrophysical Journal Letters, reveals ""a snapshot of an environment that is very similar to our solar system, but at a much earlier stage of its evolution,"" Bohn said.

The star — officially known as TYC 8998-760-1 and located in the Musca, or the Fly, constellation — is barely 17 million years old. By contrast, our sun is 4.5 billion years old.

The two newly discovered gas giants around this young star orbit at a much greater distance than Jupiter and Saturn do our sun — requiring a few thousand years to complete one revolution, or calendar year. They also weigh in with greater masses than our own outer planets.

The researchers took multiple images of this youthful solar system over the past year to verify the findings, while reviewing older data. A disk on the telescope known as a coronagraph blocked the starlight, exposing the two much fainter planets.

Future instruments like ESO's Extremely Large Telescope, still five years away, should be able to detect even smaller, less dense planets. The main mirror will span 39 metres, more than four times the size of the Very Large Telescope, making it the ""the world's biggest eye on the sky,"" according to the ESO.

For now, there is no evidence that this young star has more planets, but ""it is certainly possible and they might just be too faint,"" Bohn said",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/exoplanets-photograph-1.5658583?cmp=rss,news,technology,

In what was a virtual sprint for the 5,000 and 10,000-metre specialist, the 29-year-old won the 1,500 in three minutes 34.89 seconds at the Bowerman Track Club intrasquad meet in Portland, Ore.

The time makes the Somalia-born, St. Catharines, Ont.-raised runner the fifth-fastest Canadian at the distance.

On July 10 in Portland, Ahmed shattered his own national record in the 5,000, running 12:47.20 to eclipse his previous mark of 12:53.16 set last summer in Rome when he became the first Canadian to dip under 13 seconds. The time vaulted the two-time Olympian to 10th all-time in the world.

29-year-old Moh Ahmed of St. Catharines, Ont., ran the 5,000 metres race at the Portland Intersquad Meet in 12 minutes 47.20 seconds, bettering his previous mark of 12:53.16 set last summer in Rome. 18:09

Tuesday's fast 1,500, in front of an empty stadium due to COVID-19, was just three seconds shy of Kevin Sullivan's Canadian record of 3:31.71 set in 2000.

Only three other Canadians have run faster than Ahmed over that distance: Graham Hood (3:33.94), Nate Brannen (3:34.22), and Charles Philibert-Thiboutot (3:34.23).

Ahmed won bronze in the 5,000 last October at the world track and field championships in Doha, Qatar.

""Third is good. This is a stepping stone,"" said Ahmed, who was looking ahead to 2020 and the Tokyo Olympics before it was postponed in March due to the coronavirus pandemic and rescheduled to July 2021.

In June, Athletics Canada recognized Ahmed's feat as the most outstanding performance of 2019 by awarding Ahmed the Cal D. Bricker Memorial Trophy.

Ahmed was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and moved to Canada at the age of 11. He trains with the Bowerman Track Club in Portland.

CBC Sports analyst Dave Moorcroft, who ran a world-record 13:00.41 in 1982, noted Ahmed has arrived as a serious medal contender and wondered if he was on the verge of ""something special"" come Tokyo.

""Medal contenders have a different mindset and aura, and I believe Moh has that,"" Moorcroft said.

Const. Allan Young, 55, had been on life support at a hospital in the B.C. Interior after being attacked in Nelson, B.C., last week. The department confirmed his death in a statement early Wednesday.

""Const. Young passed away peacefully last night surrounded by those who love him,"" the statement said.

""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our brother officer. His smile, personality and character cannot be replaced and will forever echo in our hallways.""

Young was attacked after ""intervening in a disturbance"" in Nelson on Thursday.

Local police said Young approached another man downtown in the 600-block of Baker Street around 11:45 p.m. PT.

""It appears that one male was causing a disturbance in the roadway when the victim approached him and a physical altercation ensued,"" the Nelson Police Department said.

A 26-year-old man was arrested after the attack. A statement from Nelson police on Wednesday said the man is now facing charges of aggravated assault, but did not release his name.

Police said Young and the attacker did not know each other.

20-year police veteran joined Navy as a teen

Abbotsford police said Young had been with the department since March 2004. He had previously worked with the Toronto Police Service since 2000, after immigrating to Canada from Scotland in 1997.

Young was born and raised in Dumbarton, Scotland, and at age 16 enlisted with the British Royal Navy, where he was a marine engineering mechanic.

""He would light up the room. He had a very, very thick [Scottish] accent. If you could decipher the joke, it was usually very funny, but even if you couldn't understand what he said, the happiness and fun that he brought into a room was contagious,"" Abbotsford police Sgt.

CBC Sports has not independently confirmed the reports.

The Blue Jays had originally sought approval for a plan to play its 30 regular-season games at home, but was denied by the federal government last week due to the risks of travelling back and forth from the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic.

Toronto had considered playing at its spring training facility in Dunedin, Fla., or at Sahlen Field, the home of the Jays' triple-A affiliate in Buffalo, N.Y. However, surging coronavirus cases in Florida and a lack of space and lighting concerns in Buffalo raised doubts about the potential sites.

The agreement to share PNC Park with the Pittsburgh Pirates is pending state approval, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Wednesday because they were not authorized to speak ahead of the government decision.

On Monday, Pirates president Travis Williams said the team welcomed a shared arrangement with the Jays if it could happen safely, while Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said he was excited about the PNC Park option and his Pittsburgh counterpart Derek Shelton said he would have no problem with Toronto moving in.

Founder and president Virgile Rostand will also step aside from the Toronto-based company, which creates tools for people to access digital currency markets, as part of the settlement agreement approved on Tuesday by the Ontario Securities Commission.

25204,2020-07-22 9:41,"Inflation rate swings back to positive territory in June, up 0.7% for the year","Canada's inflation rate swung back into positive territory in June, with consumer prices rising at a 0.7 per cent annual pace.

In May, during the depths of COVID-19 lockdowns, Canada's inflation rate dipped to -0.4 per cent, the second straight month below zero. If inflation below zero persists, that's a very worrisome economic trend known as deflation, but June's figures suggest that it may have been a temporary blip.

On a monthly, seasonally adjusted basis, the inflation rate rose by a full per cent in June alone. That's the largest monthly rise on that metric since the GST began in 1991, Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter noted, and it's mainly because of big bounceback in prices for things like books, gasoline and electricity, which saw huge price plunges in the earliest days of the pandemic.

The 0.7 per cent annual figure was twice as good as the 0.3 per cent rebound that economists had been expecting, and while that's encouraging to see, Porter says the strong number shows just how far the economy has yet to come to fully recover.

""While this is a big shift from two months of headline deflation, it's still below the bottom end of the [Bank of Canada]'s comfort range for inflation,"" which is between one and three per cent, he said.

Economist James Marple at TD Bank was similarly cautious, saying ""deflation is not an immediate risk to the Canadian economy, but the road ahead will be long and challenges to maintaining economic momentum will come.""

25215,2020-07-22 9:07,Feds relax fingerprinting rules while screening new hires during pandemic,"The government has quietly relaxed a requirement to fingerprint prospective new federal hires as part of security screening, a move prompted by the need for physical distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.

A temporary change to the federal standard on security screening allows departments and agencies subject to the Policy on Government Security to grant conditional security statuses and clearances, the Treasury Board Secretariat said.

The government must ensure it can effectively respond to public needs during the pandemic by hiring badly needed workers, the secretariat said.

""This has required urgently increasing the workforce necessary to implement the government's emergency measures and to provide support where urgently needed, like health-care workers in Indigenous and northern communities.""

The secretariat said that given the physical distancing practices recommended by the Public Health Agency of Canada, it is ""not always possible to obtain fingerprints,"" a common step in carrying out a criminal record check during screening.

The decision to grant a conditional security screening clearance under the temporary change in practice is the responsibility of the deputy head within each department or agency, based on individual circumstances.

Agencies conducting alternative screening measures

Agencies continue to ""diligently assess"" candidates using security screening measures in a manner that does not present a public health risk, the secretariat said.

""This includes, for example, verifying a candidate's identity and background, information, education and professional credentials and performing a credit check.

""This may include conducting name-based checks for law enforcement inquiries as an alternative to using digital fingerprints or extending the validity of existing screening levels that are due for revalidation during this period.""

All candidates for employment with the government are also required to self-declare the existence of a criminal record on the security screening application form.

""We are encouraging departments and agencies to only use this conditional screening practice for low-risk positions,"" the secretariat said.

Even with the variation, access to classified information remains restricted only to employees who have been granted the appropriate security screening status, it said.

""Under these circumstances, any letters of offer would be conditional on the security screening ultimately being successfully completed and the employee being confirmed at the appropriate security screening level for the position.""

Between mid-March and May, 13 new hires at the Canadian Space Agency received conditional security clearances with no fingerprints, said Andrea Matte, a spokesperson for the agency.

""Additional screening activities and security measures were put in place.""

Since May, with new sanitation measures available, the space agency has been able to take fingerprints for all but two of these new hires and they are now fully cleared, Matte said.

The direction from Treasury Board indicated the measure was meant for agencies that grant employees a level known as ""reliability status,"" whereas the RCMP uses the higher level of ""enhanced reliability status"" given the nature of its work and security levels within the organization, said Catherine Fortin, an RCMP spokesperson.

""The RCMP did not provide the authority to implement this measure, and as a result there is no indication it was ever used in our organization,"" she said. During the pandemic, hiring has been done on a priority basis and each of the regions had its own processes for use of personal protective equipment and cleaning protocols, Fortin said.

""Any individuals being hired at this time would have to be considered critical.""

TBS has also encouraged departments and agencies to only use this conditional screening practice for low-risk positions.

Because the total number of conditional clearances granted using the variation will depend on decisions made within each department, an estimate of the number of people affected is not available, the Treasury Board Secretariat said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fingerprint-hiring-covid19-1.5658483?cmp=rss,news,politics,

25199,2020-07-22 8:26,"Canada's Kia Nurse, Bridget Carleton find comfort in basketball at WNBA bubble","Late July in Florida can be hot.

But if the heat is the toughest adjustment WNBA players have to make IN their bubble at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., things must be going pretty well.

Canadian WNBAers Kia Nurse, a New York Liberty guard, and Bridget Carleton, a Minnesota Lynx forward, both made a point of noting the high temperatures in their new home.

""At first I was like, 'Oh I haven't ridden a bike in years, this will be fun,"" Nurse said. ""And [then] I'm like, 'It's hot and I'm tired all the time and I don't need this extra fitness.'""

Carleton said the heat affects her more in the gym.

""It's very hot and sticky here, which I'm not mad at. It's kind of nice to get some vitamin D in. But yeah, it's very hot coming out of practice all sweaty and then you walk outside, you're still sweating.""

Otherwise, Nurse, 24, and Carleton, 23, said their bubble experience has been pleasant.The WNBA season begins Friday, with Nurse's Liberty taking on the Seattle Storm. Carleton's Lynx debut Saturday against the Sun.

Both players are living with two teammates — Carleton is staying with fellow Canadian Kayla Alexander — and neither mentioned any of the hotel-room dirtiness that circulated social media when players first arrived.

The average day for both features a morning that could include a workout, followed by practice from 1 to 4 p.m. Then it's time for coronavirus testing, where two are administered per day — one by throat, one by nose. At night, there's an optional shootaround.

Free time for Nurse has been spent on a bike — though the heat may be putting an end to that — while Carleton says she uses her free time mainly for rest and recovery, with the occasional pool visit. She's also had to cook meals for herself after opting out of the league's meal plan initially.

""I've been living at home and my parents have been doing most of the cooking so I was like, 'OK I should be an adult and cook for myself a little bit.' But I'm over it now, I'm ready for someone else to cook for me again,"" Carleton said.

Basketball, of course, remains the top priority.

""What's nice about playing basketball is it's a way for us to kind of forget what's going on in the world right now, forget that we're in a bubble,"" Carleton said. ""During those three hours of practice we're in our comfort zone. That's what we're used to doing, is playing with our teammates having fun.""

Nurse agreed that it's nice just to be playing competitive basketball again.

""I feel like we've been in this bubble for three years and it's like 15 days. But I think it's been something that's really exciting, just in the sense that for the last two months it was just me and my trainer in the gym and no one else.""

Drawing on national team experience

While much has been similar, Carleton and Nurse enter the 2020 season at very different stages of their careers.

Carleton, of Chatham, Ont., was drafted 21st overall by the Connecticut Sun last year, but cut by the team mid-season before catching on with the Lynx. Over eight games between the two clubs, she averaged five minutes and scored three points on 1-for-8 shooting.

Entering her sophomore season, Carleton hopes to make a name for herself. The six-foot-two forward played impactful minutes with Team Canada at the FIBA Americup and Olympic qualifiers last year.

The national team experience has helped ease the transition to the bubble.

""I think there's some familiarity with that which makes it easier and I kind of wasn't expecting. I thought this was all going to be strange, all going to be weird, but that's kind of something I'm used to almost, so that's kind of been the coolest thing,"" Carleton said.

Nurse, meanwhile, enters her third season in the league referring to herself as a ""baby vet."" The Liberty, armed a new coach, embraced the youth movement this season and brought a league-record seven rookies to Florida.

That means Nurse, coming off her first all-star appearance, has been tasked with taking on more of a leadership role. The Hamilton, Ont., native says her style is less vocal and more by example.

""What's interesting with me and my career is I got pulled up to the Olympic team at 16 years old, so there was really this big gap… and as I continue to go — I've been there now for like eight years — I'm still technically the fourth youngest on the team but I'm a vet because I've been there forever,"" Nurse said.

Pushing for social justice

The national team recently met with the Canadian Olympic Committee to discuss the IOC's controversial Rule 50 barring protests on the field of play. Carleton wasn't able to attend the meeting due to practice, but said she hears it was productive.

""There was a lot of different opinions about it. To take it away completely might not be the best answer but to implement it, make some changes might be better fit for everyone.""

Nurse said she's in a unique situation living in two countries. She said racism in Canada and the U.S. can reveal itself in different ways.

""A lot of conversation is actually about the Aboriginal community within Canada. The Indigenous people, the treatment of them and then also the treatment obviously of Black people and other people of colour.

""[I'm] trying to really voice my opinion on different things and voice what needs to change, both in the Canadian side of the sport and diversity there as well as what goes on in America.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/wnba-nurse-carleton-bubble-life-1.5658334?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,

The United States encountered a new setback in the coronavirus battle as separate analyses indicated the country on Tuesday had slipped back to once again recording more than 1,000 deaths in a 24-hour period.

Both the COVID Tracking Project and data compiled by the Washington Post put the death toll in the latest 24-hour tracking period as between 1,000 and 1,100, a threshold not seen since early June, and not regularly since May. Health experts soberly warned of such developments after recent weeks of an upsurge in cases, particularly in the south and southwest regions.

Swaths of the country are now battling rising infections and growing deaths, and some states are once again having to close businesses and rethink school in the fall. Many retailers themselves are insisting their customers don masks. For months, the nation's top health experts have pleaded with Americans to wear masks in public and steer clear of crowds — calling those simple steps life-saving — even as President Donald Trump's stance on masks fuelled a partisan social divide.

As recently as a Fox News interview recorded last week and broadcast four days ago, Trump said ""masks cause problems, too.""

But at a White House briefing on Tuesday, Trump gave his most unequivocal advice so far to Americans on masks.

""We're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask,"" he said. ""Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.""

""We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings,"" Trump, who was not wearing a mask himself, went on. ""Be safe and be smart.""

But elsewhere, Trump did not provide any tangible updates on progress for a vaccine and said the administration was ""in the process of developing a strategy.""

Health officials who have been part of the White House's coronavirus task force were not present. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told NPR Tuesday that he was glad Trump has begun to promote mask-wearing.

""If we, during those conferences, come out and have consistent, clear, noncontradictory messages, I believe it will be very helpful in getting people on the track of knowing the direction that we need to go to get this pandemic under control,"" he said.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was not as forgiving of Trump as he outlined the latest plank of his economic recovery plan on Tuesday, charging that Trump had ""quit on this country.""

Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, lawmakers were negotiating what is expected to be a trillion-dollar-or-more ""Phase Four"" rescue package.

Texas on Tuesday represented the mixed bag of developments as the U.S. battles the coronavirus, as well as the political jousting sometimes seen on who has authority over public health advice.

Dallas County officials said the number of hospitalized coronavirus patients dropped below 1,000 on Tuesday for the first time in more than two weeks, and officials in Houston are seeing signs of optimism.

But officials in counties along the border with Mexico said the outlook there remains bleak. In Starr County, Judge Eloy Vera said ""we're very close to losing the situation"" and the county plans to issue voluntary stay-at-home recommendations this week.

Vera said it would be similar to one issued Monday in Hidalgo County, which set a curfew and recommends that all nonessential businesses cease any activity that can't be provided at curbside or by takeout.

The orders, however, are not enforceable under Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's past mandates that do not allow local officials to set their own stay-at-home restrictions. Texas on Tuesday reported more than 9,300 confirmed new cases and 131 deaths, the state's second-deadliest day of the pandemic.

More than 500 women at Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, one of the largest confirmed outbreaks at a federal prison.

What's happening with coronavirus in Canada

As of 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Canada has seen 111,699 coronavirus infections. Provinces and territories listed 97,757 of those as recovered or resolved, with a total of 5,048 still active. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,894.

In Ottawa, legislation introduced by the Liberal government to change the federal wage subsidy and provide relief to people with disabilities passed in the House of Commons on Tuesday by unanimous consent.

The legislation, Bill C-20, expands the number of companies that qualify for the wage subsidy, changes the amount companies can put toward their workers' wages and extends the wage subsidy program to the end of the year.

The bill also sends a one-time payment of $600 to people with disabilities and extends some legal deadlines for court cases.

What's happening in the rest of the world

Iran says 138 health-care professionals have died so far while battling the coronavirus pandemic. The semi-official ISNA news agency on Wednesday quoted Hossein Kermanpour, spokesperson for the regulatory body for Iranian health-care professionals, as saying that the death toll includes 90 doctors and 28 nurses.

Iran is grappling with the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East. It has so far reported more than 278,000 confirmed cases and 14,634 deaths. On Tuesday, the country saw its single-day highest death toll at 229.

In Australia, the state of Victoria reported a record 484 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as health authorities warned that numbers could continue to rise.

With Australia's second-largest city Melbourne now in lockdown for two weeks, authorities had hoped the infection rate would begin to plateau. Instead, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said ""we're going to look at 500-600 cases per day. I absolutely don't want us to go there.""

Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews announced two more deaths, both men in their 90s, bringing the national death toll to 128.

Face masks will become compulsory from Thursday for residents in lockdown regions when they leave their homes.

Neighbouring New South Wales state reported 16 new cases on Wednesday.

The government of Nepal has ended a lockdown 120 days after it was imposed to control the spread of coronavirus.

Information Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada said the number of cases was declining in Nepal. Khatiwada said schools and colleges would remain closed until further notice, but government and private offices would be fully functional from Wednesday, and markets, malls and shops would be also be allowed to open.

Airports and commercial flights will resume on Aug. 1. The country has seen 17,994 confirmed cases and 40 deaths from the coronavirus.

South Africa has well over half of the confirmed coronavirus cases on the African continent, with new Health Ministry data showing 381,798 cases, including 5,368 deaths.

The country's current epicentre is Gauteng province, home to Johannesburg and one-quarter of the population. It has over one-third of South Africa's cases.

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has pleaded with people to guard against pandemic fatigue and urged them not to abandon face masks.

While the country is now legitimately a global hot spot, its percentage of total African cases partially reflects a limited testing capacity in several countries on the continent.

The director of the Pan American Health Organization, a UN public health agency with offices throughout Central and South America, as well as the U.S. and the Caribbean, said Tuesday the pandemic is showing ""no signs of slowing down"" in many of its member nations. The virus has landed in the Guiana shield countries on South America's northeastern coast and surges have also been detected in Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru, Carissa Etienne said.

Etienne said there were nearly 900,000 new cases and nearly 22,000 deaths reported in the region over the past week, with large nations Brazil, Mexico and the United States accounting for the bulk of the numbers.

But PAHO said Tuesday that Nicaragua hasn't given the organization authorization to send in a team of experts to evaluate the coronavirus outbreak in the Central American country. The organization urged Nicaragua to take more aggressive measures against the virus.

The Nicaraguan Health Ministry gave a periodic update Tuesday, claiming deaths had increased from 99 to 108 and confirmed cases rose to 3,439. The civic group Citizens Observatory, however, said independent doctors and activists had collected reports of 2,260 deaths and 8,508 cases.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-july-22-covid-19-1.5658410?cmp=rss,news,world,

25182,2020-07-22 7:35,"Olympics not possible under current conditions, Tokyo organizer says","The delayed Tokyo Olympics could not be held next year if conditions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic continue as they are, the president of the organizing committee said Wednesday.

In an interview with Japanese broadcaster NHK, Yoshiro Mori said he was hopeful the situation would improve and suggested a vaccine was the key.

""If this kind of situation [with COVID-19] continues, is it possible to hold the games?"" Mori was asked by NHK.

""If current situation continues, we couldn't,"" Mori replied, speaking in Japanese.

The Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to open on July 23, 2021 — a year from Thursday. A small, 15-minute ceremony without fans is scheduled for Thursday at the new national stadium to mark the date.

The International Olympic Committee and Japanese organizers have repeatedly expressed confidence the games will take place, though they have offered few details on how they can happen in the middle of a pandemic.

The IOC and organizers have also said the Olympics will not be postponed again and would be cancelled.

""It would be too much for us to answer each of these hypothetical questions,"" Mori said. ""I don't think this situation will last for another year.""

Researchers have said a vaccine could be six-to-nine months away, which Mori said was the key. Some, however, question if young athletes should be a priority, and if all would agree to be vaccinated.

""Whether the Olympics can be done or not is about whether humanity can beat the coronavirus,"" Mori said. ""Specifically, to develop a vaccine or drug is the first point.""

Organizers and the IOC say they want to simplify the games to help reduce the soaring costs. But officials cannot say now if fans will be permitted next year, or if athletes will face quarantines. They say few details will be available until the fall.

Plans call for the full contingent of 11,000 Olympic athletes and 4,400 Paralympic athletes to be competing at 42 venues.

About 1,000 deaths in Japan have been attributed to the coronavirus. Tokyo has seen a rising number of daily cases in the last few weeks, which reached a high of almost 300 last week.

25177,2020-07-22 7:06,Twitter says it will crack down on tweets involving conspiracy theory group QAnon,"Twitter Inc. said Tuesday it would permanently suspend accounts that violate its policies while tweeting about QAnon, a fringe group that claims ""deep-state"" traitors are plotting against U.S. President Donald Trump.

Twitter, which announced the change on its Twitter Safety page, said it would not serve content and accounts associated with QAnon in trends and recommendations, and would block URLs associated with the group from being shared on the platform.

The suspension, which will be rolled out this week, is expected to impact about 150,000 accounts globally, Twitter said. It said that more than 7,000 accounts have been removed in the last several weeks for violating the company's rules against spam, platform manipulation and ban evasion.

The suspensions will be applied to accounts ""engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, co-ordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension — something we've seen more of in recent weeks,"" Twitter said.

We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm. In line with this approach, this week we are taking further action on so-called ‘QAnon’ activity across the service. —@TwitterSafety

In online conspiracies, the term ""deep-state"" is used to refer to a combination of elites from the intelligence, political, business and entertainment fields, with QAnon's theories claiming that the ""deep-state"" is at a secret war with Trump.

QAnon has also claimed that Democratic Party members are behind international crime rings. The group's content has spread widely on mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. Earlier this year, Facebook removed a U.S. network of fake accounts linked to QAnon.

Last year, the FBI issued a warning about ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" and designated QAnon as a potential domestic extremist threat.

What's not clear is how the social media giant will handle accounts that have a significant profile or involve active politicians.

25206,2020-07-22 6:00,Métis man wants visitors to stop cutting across his property to see Manitoba caves,"The owner of a property that features Instagram-worthy caves would like to see a plan put in place before tourists venture out to the community for photos.

""We just want to enjoy the land, that's where our ancestors are from,"" said KC Bruce.

Bruce and his family own two of the properties that are closest to the caves of Pine Dock, Manitoba, which is located just over 200 kilometres north of Winnipeg.

Online travel blogs have listed the site as a must-see destination in Manitoba, and post directions to the site which ask people to cut through Bruce's property to access the natural caves, which are located on crown land.

KC Bruce's family owns the property and says it has been a part of their family for generations. People trespass through his private land to get to the caves and he would like to see a plan in place before people visit there. (Submitted/Zachary Friesen)

Just this past weekend, he says they lost track after they counted 80 visitors walking through the property, and that there isn't enough space for him to park his vehicle on his own property.

""We got signs up that say private property, and people just keep walking. They don't even acknowledge us,"" said Bruce, who is Anishinaabe-Cree and Metis.

He says that his grandmother, Bernice Scott, was born there and that his family has been there since the early 1900's.

Bruce says that his grandma, who was a respected Métis Elder, had her ashes spread throughout the property after she passed in 2007.

The community of Pine Dock has a population of close to 50 people and Bruce says that the majority of its residents are Métis.

Over the past few years, the caves have seen an influx of visitors after becoming a popular destination thanks to social media and travel blogs.

Travel Manitoba recently posted on Instagram that due to concerns around people accessing the caves, they took down a blog post from 2016 ""marvelling at their beauty"" — though they didn't include directions to the site.

Bruce, who lives in Winnipeg, travels out to his family's cabin to de-stress and says that it's tough to relax with tons of visitors cutting through to access the site.

""We don't want to be seeing 100 people a day cut through our property,"" said Bruce.

Making sure a plan is in place

KC Bruce says his family has been hunting and trapping in the area for generations. (Submitted/KC Bruce)

He says that his family used to use the caves to store food and that they are home to bats. He says that people who show up sometimes come unprepared for the hike, and he also fears that visitors will bring COVID-19 to the small community.

While Bruce is not completely opposed to people visiting the site, he would like to see action taken by the province or crown lands manager — including a new path to the caves, as well as signage pointing out the dangers associated with visiting the caves.

""The very first approach when you get to the cave, you have to walk across a plank and it's probably 80 feet down [to the bottom], and if you fall in there you're dead,'' said Bruce.

""People are coming in with flip flops and little toddlers and kids and they just don't know what they're getting into.""

Visitor learns valuable lesson

One of the people who showed up this weekend was Zach Friesen.

Zachary Friesen got a tour of the caves this weekend. He would like to see people do more research on the places they plan to visit. (Submitted/Zachary Friesen)

Friesen, who is from Winnipeg, likes to hike and has been visiting Manitoba destinations with his girlfriend. He made a social media post about the caves this weekend after he learned a valuable lesson.

""We had no idea that it was located on public or private land,"" Friesen said.

After getting a tour with one of Bruce's relatives, Friesen learned that he needs to do more research before visiting new places.

""In talking to the family, it put a dampening on the experience,"" said Friesen. ""I felt so bad for what the family was going through and the disrespect that was shown through the garbage.""

Bruce added that recent visitors have spray painted the cave and that people have been leaving their garbage throughout the property.

In an email to CBC, a provincial spokesperson wrote that ""the province is aware of local concerns with increased tourist traffic in the Pine Dock caves area and is willing to work with the local community to address issues such as improved signage so visitors know where to go, and do not inadvertently trespass on private property.

""The province encourages people to visit natural spaces, but to ensure they practice 'leave no trace' visiting by taking all their garbage with them, and being careful to respect the local environment.""

Bruce said he has no plans on turning the site into a business venture and that he would like to use it for cultural purposes in the future.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/metis-man-property-trespassing-pine-dock-caves-1.5658161?cmp=rss,news,indigenous,

Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin condemned the action, which comes at a time of rising tensions between the world's two largest economies. He warned of firm countermeasures if the U.S. does not reverse its decision.

""The unilateral closure of China's consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,"" Wang said at a daily news briefing.

Besides its embassy in Beijing, the U.S. has five consulates in mainland China, according to its website. They are in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan and Shenyang.

The U.S. said in a brief statement that the consulate was ordered closed ""to protect American intellectual property and American's private information."" It did not provide any details.

25179,2020-07-22 5:30,Sailor sounds alarm after Americans approved to join St. John's ship without isolating,"Sailors aboard an offshore supply vessel based in St. John's are worried for their safety after the provincial government approved four American technicians to join the ship without self-isolating upon entering the province.

Several crew members on the Maersk Nexus have opposed the company's decision to bring in the workers from Oil States Industries to join them as the ship heads to Quebec for repairs next month.

Oil States Industries has several bases in Texas, where COVID-19 is surging at a rate rivalled only by Florida.

""Under normal circumstances this is a normal procedure, but COVID-19 has changed everything,"" the crew wrote in an email to the federal government from the ship's email address. ""We feel this is a health issue to us and our families.""

In response to questions from CBC News, a Maersk executive said the Americans will arrive in St. John's around Aug. 11, and proceed straight to their hotel where they will be tested for the virus. The test must come back negative before they can board the ship, which is due to depart for a shipyard in Les Méchins, Que., on Aug. 12.

They love to talk about safety until it really comes down to it. - Maersk crewmember

""These four persons would have also been tested prior to leaving the U.S.,"" said Francois-Xavier Morency, the managing director of Maersk's operations in Canada. ""An exemption to quarantine from the N.L. government has been received for these four persons.""

A new case of COVID-19 arose in Prince Edward Island earlier this month from a health-care worker who travelled from outside the Atlantic bubble with a similar arrangement. He tested negative upon entering the province, as per regulations, but then tested positive a week later, after working seven shifts at a Charlottetown hospital.

Premier Dwight Ball said last week more than 9,900 people have received exemptions to enter Newfoundland and Labrador, but it's not known how many of them were also exempt from the standard isolation orders.

The provincial government says it hasn't kept a tally of how many people have been exempt from isolation and where they came from. Aside from workers deemed essential, every traveller from outside Atlantic Canada has to spend 14 days quarantined in the province before they can go out in public.

The ship's refit was mandated by Transport Canada before the pandemic. Maersk could have applied to the federal agency to delay the repair work, but opted instead to schedule it for August.

Exemptions undercut safety, says crew member

A concerned crew member spoke to CBC News on the condition of anonymity, as they fear they could lose their job for speaking out.

They said there is no way to keep a distance of two metres between each worker on the ship, and are concerned what could happen if one of the Texans walks aboard the ship with COVID-19.

Some of the St. John's crew members have vulnerable family members, or have their own underlying conditions that could make COVID-19 a fatal infection.

Maersk has a thorough COVID-19 safety plan, but the crew member said the company undercut any commitments it had to worker safety when it sought exemptions to isolation orders for the Texan technicians.

""They love to talk about safety until it really comes down to it,"" the crew member said.

Europeans will meet the ship in Quebec

Internal emails provided to CBC show Maersk initially expected there to be 55 people on board the boat once it made the three-day voyage from St. John's to Les Méchins.

A later manifest showed 35 workers, including 10 from the Norweigian company Kongsberg, who are set to join the team in Quebec.

Maersk says those European workers will be working on repairs at the shipyard, but will not be staying on board the ship.

""The yard protocols will be followed, including temperature checks of all persons entering the yard,"" a spokesperson for Maersk wrote in a response to CBC. ""All persons entering the yard must also complete a COVID protocol form for the yard. There are no cases in this part of Quebec.""

There will be a crew change partway through the month-long refit, and Maersk is also seeking exemptions to self-isolation orders for the Newfoundland and Labrador workers aboard the ship when they return to the province from Quebec.

That's where the whistleblower is worried the worst could happen. The province has become accustomed to life without cases, after spending the majority of the last three months without COVID-19 anywhere in Newfoundland and Labrador.

With restrictions loosened and people living freer daily lives, the crew member worries his ship could be the source of an outbreak.

CBC News requested information from the provincial government on aspects of this story, but a response was not received as of publishing time.

25180,2020-07-22 5:00,"Meet da Vinci, the QEII hospital's surgical robot","Warren Connors works with robots every day at work, but he never imagined his life would be saved by one.

Connors was diagnosed with cancer in November. He went to the emergency department at the QEII hospital in Halifax thinking he had kidney stones. Instead, they found tumours on both his kidneys.

""Friday night, I was indestructible and that Saturday morning, it was 'Oh my God, am I going to die?'"" he said of the shock of the news.

His urologic oncologist told him he was going to try an innovative way to remove the cancer: by using Atlantic Canada's first surgical robot to cut it out.

By day, Connors leads a robotics team that scours the sea floor for explosives. He said the irony wasn't lost on him that similar technology would be used in his surgery.

Dr. Ricardo Rendon says the robot gives him a magnified view during an operation. He likens driving the robot to a fancy car. (QEII Foundation)

""It's this big robot with multiple arms and it's making noise and it's moving,"" he said. ""They don't look like a friendly nurse smiling at you as you're falling asleep.""

Connors's surgeon, Dr. Ricardo Rendon, said he's seen all types of reactions from patients who learn they'll be part of a pilot program at the QEII to test the robot surgery system.

While an assistant sits with the patient, Rendon stays in a control room, controlling the robot that performs the procedure.

""It's like driving a fancy car,"" Rendon said.

The robot provides magnified images to the surgeon who can then be more precise, and perform more complex procedures.

""There are many tools out there that are a slight improvement, but this particular tool is an amazing improvement for the benefit of the patients,"" Rendon said.

'Such a precise job,' says patient

Connors has now had two robot surgeries. He recovered quickly from the first operation. Both his tumours were cut out in just six weeks. His prognosis is now good.

""The cool thing was that by using robotics, they were able to do such a precise job that I was able to save some of my left kidney, which was a big deal because I'm only 43.""

The da Vinci Robot performed its first surgery in Halifax in February 2019. Little did the hospital realize just how valuable the timing would be, said Rendon.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the province, all but life-saving procedures were cancelled. Just one month after the shutdown, robot surgeries got the all-clear to restart treating cancer patients.

""One of the advantages is that the length of the stay is shorter,"" said Rendon. ""The patients get to go home a lot faster, so it cuts back the time of exposure of the patient to hospital or nursing staff.""

da Vinci not a permanent QEII resident just yet

Rendon said the robot could help allow surgeries to continue if the province faces a second wave of the coronavirus or shuts down, but the da Vinci Robot still isn't a permanent fixture in the QEII.

It's currently on loan from the company that made it as a pilot project. The QEII Foundation has raised $7.1 million to bring it to Halifax and train staff. It needs another million dollars to make sure it stays.

Rendon is making the pitch, hoping more people will see that the upfront costs are worth the investment, because faster recoveries will free up much-needed hospital beds.

Rendon said five surgeons in urologic oncology and gynecologic oncology have been regularly using the machine. They've performed more than 200 procedures since it arrived. Now, it's piquing the interest of other departments.

""It is a new program. We are making sure that it is successful,"" he said. ""Eventually, we will need a second robot.""

25207,2020-07-22 5:00,"Sask. theatre artists of colour say racism, tokenism persists in local industry","Theatre artist Logan Martin-Arcand asked an administrator for Persephone Theatre — the company Martin-Arcand worked for — what the theatre was doing to uplift local artists of colour at a 2018 Persephone event.

The response took him aback.

""[A senior member of the theatre administration] started yelling at me and pointing at me from the podium,"" Martin-Arcand said. ""He said the most striking thing: there just aren't enough local Indigenous artists who are at the right level for me to put them on the Main Stage.""

Martin-Arcand resigned from Persephone a few weeks later.

He is one of several theatre artists of colour CBC spoke to about what it's like working in the industry in Saskatchewan. They described barriers to inclusion and a lack of equity in the province and across the prairies.

'A lot of room for improvement'

Martin-Arcand said he did not feel comfortable confronting Persephone's administration after he was shouted down at a company event.

""It showed [that person] didn't see any worth in Indigenous people and he was the one, solely, who got to decide where the appropriate level of work is,"" Martin-Arcand said. ""I realized I couldn't work for a business that used me as a form of representation but didn't actually see any value in the stories of my community.""

Persephone Theatre board chair Nikki Hipkin said this week the theatre is committed to doing a better job of supporting local and emerging artists of colour going forward.

""There are many talented Indigenous artists in Saskatoon,"" she said. ""We've had a commitment to Indigenous programming in our theatre, but there's been a failure in practice. We haven't done it right. And there's a lot of room for improvement in how we treat the humans in our building.""

According to Saskatchewan Association of Theatre Professionals (SATP) executive director Mark Claxton, institutional power in the theatre world is often concentrated among a very few people.

""Sometimes … one individual makes all the decisions around casting and hiring and has a massive influence on the culture of the organization,"" Claxton said.

This can create challenges for professionals of colour — who are often underrepresented in theatre administration — trying to work their way up in the industry.

""I think there's been too much of that, and too little accountability and not high enough standards on how that power is used,"" he said.

""That's a situation that is ripe for abuse.""

Yvonne Addai, who used to work at Persephone and now lives and works in Toronto, said she often felt tokenized as a Black actor when she was building her career in the prairies.

""I heard so many excuses like 'oh, well, there's just not enough of them' or 'they all move away,' but no one ever came to ask me what kinds of stories I would like to see on stage, or how to bring more people of colour into our audience,"" she said.

""It just felt like, 'We'll use you. We'll give you a show and say that we gave it to a person of colour, and that's it.' ""

Addai said she was often viewed as a ""diversity hire"" from theatre administrations looking to tick a box.

""I just wish I was seen as an artist and a creator, and the colour of my skin didn't determine why I got the job in other people's minds,"" she said.

Sask. theatregoers 'overwhelmingly older and white'

According to Claxton, many theatre companies in Saskatchewan are ""beholden to a subscriber base that is in most cases overwhelmingly older and white.""

He said this disincentivizes them from staging work those audiences might find challenging.

""Artistic directors will often say right out loud, we can maybe do one 'risky show' every season,"" Claxton said. ""It's often expected that those shows won't be well-attended, and there's a fear that people will tell their friends 'don't go to this.'""

There's a fear that people will tell their friends 'don't go to this.' - Mark Claxton

Martin-Arcand said this often means shows that are more relevant to communities of colour are sidelined or that, when actors of colour are cast, they are pigeonholed into specific types of roles.

""I'd love to see Indigenous people, as well as Black people and other people of colour, in all sorts of stories and presenting all sorts of plays - not just the ones that focus on Indigenous or Black trauma or racism,"" he said.

Theatres often operate on tight margins. Claxton said this makes it difficult to strive for what he believes would ultimately be a more successful model, where more diverse audiences sustain more diverse content on stage.

""There's this unending, relentless cycle of programming and budgeting that doesn't allow time to get a bit proactive in the kinds of markets we want to reach out to, rather than fighting tooth and nail to keep the current demographic coming to theatres,"" he said.

Pushing boundaries in casting

Yulissa Campos is the creator of Ay, Caramba! Theatre, the first Latinx theatre company in Saskatoon. She said there is a vicious cycle at play in the Saskatchewan theatre community, where actors of colour are implicitly discouraged from auditioning for shows because theatres have a history of casting all-white actors.

""I start thinking someone like me doesn't fit in with the director's vision of the play and the cast,"" she said.

Campos also works in the box office at Persephone Theatre. She got excited in 2018 when she learned Persephone's production of Pride and Prejudice would have a racially diverse cast. She hoped it signalled more opportunities for actors like her. So far, she has not seen that possibility bear fruit.

""I audition sometimes, when I see a show where they could push the boundaries with ethnicity, but I'm always disappointed because they always end up choosing an all-white cast,"" she said. ""I keep hoping to have an opportunity, and then they disappoint me every time.""

Regina-born Natasha Strilchuk, who now lives in Toronto but frequently returns to the Prairies for shows, has had a similar experience as a South Asian actor.

""If you see a director's body of work and you don't see many people that look like you … it's hard to say 'Well, am I the person that they need to be in that?' ""she said.

She said she has to work harder than her white peers to help directors ""justify their decision to cast me in things."" She seeks out directors who have a history of being thoughtful and intentional about integrating diversity into their work.

Martin-Arcand said his opportunities have also been limited because he is seen as less versatile, or more inherently distinctive, than a non-Indigenous professional.

""There's this idea that the 'ideal' human would a a white cisgender heterosexual male,"" he said. ""Everything that is not that has some sort of caveat put before it, or some sort of indicator that really says we are a human below that neutral.""

Claxton said that discrimination in the audition process can be hard to identify and easy to deny when it is present.

""It's so easy for a director or a theatre manager not to say the words out loud, but simply decide not to hire a person,"" Claxton explained. ""Without feedback, an artist doesn't even know the reason. They're left to speculate.""

It can be difficult — or even risky — for theatre professionals to speak up when they see a pattern.

""You are so often in a situation where you can be one move away from feeling like you're never going to work again,"" said Claxton. ""There's all kinds of incentives not to speak up.""

While Persephone theatre does not collect demographic information on actors and employees, Martin-Arcand said he saw Persephone go many shows in a row without an Indigenous actor on its Main Stage. To him, that sent a message.

""It says they don't care about the livelihood of Indigenous people, that they don't think our stories are relatable or that we are neutral enough,"" he said. ""I'm not saying Indigenous people need to be part of every play. But we need to be a bigger part of the picture.""

For some theatre professionals of colour, the best way to get the roles they need to develop their career is to create their own work.

Regina-based theatre educator Chancz Perry said this comes with its own challenges as well.

""You need to learn to write a grant, for example, so you can mount your work successfully,"" he said. ""I can't say that a lot of people, particularly white actors, know how to go about doing that. They've always relied on people finding work for them.""

Racism from coworkers, patrons

Theatre professionals of colour also experience direct racism from coworkers or patrons.

Addai had a patron call her the N-word while she was working at the Persephone box office a few years ago.

""We were doing one of those radio ticket giveaways, and I guess someone had won and I didn't know - I hadn't been told,"" she said.

""So when he came in and was like 'I'm here to collect my ticket,' I said it wasn't ready, and I needed a few seconds. He started yelling at me, saying he had just parked in the middle of the road to come get the tickets and I'm an N-word, that I need to get myself prepared and he can't stand when people are disorganized. It was a lot of anger towards me.""

She said she also faced repeated microaggressions at the box office, such as patrons assuming she did not speak English.

She said that while her box office managers were supportive, she found it difficult to speak out about her experiences of racism because she did not feel supported by the Persephone administration. She said there was no policy she could turn to for help and encouragement.

""There was no mandate or mission statement or anything like a code of conduct to suggest [the Persephone administration] had anti-racism training or even really cared about it,"" she said.

Hipkin said hearing about Addai's experiences at Persephone has been particularly motivating for her as the theatre works on creating new anti-racist policies and updating its older statements and commitments.

""It's so unacceptable that that happened in our building,"" she said. ""Going forward, I want to make sure that all employees feel supported and welcomed and valued. I want to make sure that there are clear policies in place that are known by everybody and supported throughout the organization. I want to make sure that we are fostering an environment where we're all encouraged to speak up and step in, particularly when somebody is behaving in a racist way.""

Martin-Arcand said people would avoid saying racist things to him directly, he would still hear second-hand about things like staff joking about cast members being late because they were Indigenous.

""I think it creates this environment where we just do not feel safe,"" he said. ""We always have to be walking on eggshells, worrying about how we act and how we come across, what things we might be doing that diminish our value even further.""

We always have to be walking on eggshells... - Logan Martin-Arcand

Overdue conversations

Even when theatre companies choose to stage shows where race is a major theme, the burden of making sure diverse characters are represented authentically can be disproportionately borne by actors of colour.

""If you're doing a show that talks about a certain culture or a certain people, it needs to be done with people who know about that culture,"" said Strilchuk. ""If the director or creative team doesn't [have that knowledge], that becomes extra, usually unpaid work that can fall on the actors.""

Perry said that when theatre companies are deliberate about bringing in consultants to help them address race at every stage in the process, it can lead to more inclusive casting and more thoughtful creative decisions.

Perry worked as a consultant for Regina Summer Stage's production of Hairspray last year. He said he focused on how the company could best honour and expand on the play's intersectional themes of race, class, gender, size and ability.

Theatre educator Chancz Perry says being asked by theatre companies to share his experiences is a sign the industry is changing. (Michael Bell)

He said his being asked to come and share his expertise was a sign that the theatre world is evolving.

""No one had ever really asked me to talk about theatre as it relates to my experience in terms of race and diversity,"" he said. ""I'm going on 50 years old now, and I've been in the theatre industry since I was 16, so being approached for this made me think ... about how these conversations — way overdue — are happening so late in my life.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/theatre-diversity-representation-1.5657440?cmp=rss,news,canada,saskatchewan

25161,2020-07-22 4:00,What's behind the latest rise in coronavirus cases in Quebec?,"By late June, it appeared Quebec was finally past the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak that had brought the health care system to the brink and left thousands dead in long-term care homes.

Now, less than a month later, the province is again seeing its case count rise again, prompting a debate among experts, pundits and politicians about what has caused the sudden reversal of fortune.

On the eve of summer, the province was registering, on average, fewer than 90 new cases of coronavirus per day, a figure that just weeks earlier regularly surpassed 800.

With other public health indicators — hospitalizations, deaths — all pointing downward, Premier François Legault allowed Quebecers to gather again in small groups, and restaurants and bars were allowed to reopen.

Around this time, Benoît Mâsse, a professor of public health at the Université de Montréal, struck a discordant note.

In a June 10 interview with CBC's French-language service Radio-Canada, Mâsse predicted that by mid-July cases would be on the rise again.

""Sadly, I'm right on,"" he said Tuesday, when Quebec posted 180 new cases, its highest daily increase since June 11.

Since the start of the month, the five-day rolling average of new cases has climbed from 70 to 159.

""Although it was predictable, it is concerning,"" Mâsse said in an email exchange.

""The origin is simple: the deconfinement. Once you allow more contact, you provide oxygen to the fire.""

People — 'the big unknown'

Many in the province have been quick to blame the uptick on the reopening of bars on June 25.

But while public health officials in Montreal have traced dozens of cases to a few bars in particular, there is not yet enough publicly available evidence to pin the blame solely on them.

Information compiled by Quebec's Health Ministry suggests that between June 28 and July 4 fewer than five per cent of new cases in the province could be traced to a bar.

On the other hand, around 35 per cent were due to family contacts; 15 per cent were health care workers; 10 per cent were residents of long-term care home or inmates; another 10 per cent were traced to workplaces and various other sources. The source of the remaining 25 per cent was undetermined.

Rather than heed demands to close the bars again, Legault has opted instead to urge Quebecers to respect the 10-person limit on private gatherings.

But even within the public health guidelines on private gatherings, there is a lot of room for interpretation.

Mâsse pointed out that the rules would allow someone to have repeated 10-person parties throughout the week, though the goal is reducing everyone's exposure to risky contacts as much as possible.

""People's behaviour is the big unknown,"" he said. ""Will they respond to this [slight] increase by reducing their contacts? Or will they wait until the government imposes new restrictions?""

Other experts worry the decision to reopen bars sent the wrong message to the public by signalling that gatherings in enclosed spaces with alcohol was a risk-free activity.

""The same kind of behaviour is repeating itself in private parties,"" said Nima Machouf, an epidemiologist affiliated with the Université de Montréal.

Time to panic?

While the increase has been cause for concern for Quebec's elected officials, they are not panicking.

Legault has noted the rise in cases hasn't been accompanied by an increase in hospitalizations, nor are elderly and long-term care homes — whose residents are particularly vulnerable to the disease — being hard hit.

For epidemiologists, though, it's worrisome that the province is seeing a rise in the summer.

Quebec's annual two-week construction holiday began on the weekend. And as Quebecers travel around the province for vacation, Machouf said, there is a risk they spread the disease unknowingly, especially given roughly half of those infected don't present symptoms.

""We really have to be careful,"" she said. ""It is increasing too much … to feel like we're in control of the epidemic.""

Summer was also supposed to be when controlling the disease was easiest, with schools closed and weather that is favourable for outdoor activities.

""My worry is that if we cannot control the spread of the virus in an ideal condition like the summer … it will be a lot harder to control in the fall, and a [substantial] second wave is likely,"" said Mâsse.

Quebec isn't alone in seeing a downward trend reverse. British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario have also seen increases in recent days.

Some of that was to be expected. Keeping case counts low was always going to be difficult once provinces began lifting lockdown measures.

But as long as public officials can trace the source of the outbreaks, these mini spikes are manageable, said Erin Strumpf, a professor in McGill University's Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health.

""If we can understand the interactions that are leading to the increases in cases, then we can change our behaviour, we can change the rules,"" Strumpf said.

Quebec, for instance, introduced a provincewide rule on Saturday requiring masks be worn in indoor public spaces, including for clients in bars and restaurants who are seated.

""The thing we need to worry about — the reason to 'freak out' — is if there are unexplained, uncontrolled outbreaks going on, because there's no way to control that,"" said Strumpf.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-19-quebec-why-are-cases-increasing-1.5658082?cmp=rss,news,canada,montreal
25162,2020-07-22 4:00,Do religious face coverings count as masks? Your COVID-19 questions answered,"We're breaking down what you need to know about the pandemic. Send us your questions via email at COVID@cbc.ca and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday on our website, and we're also putting some of your questions to the experts on the air during The National and on CBC News Network. So far we've received more than 48,000 emails from all corners of the country.

Does wearing a niqab count as a non-medical face mask?

With more areas of the country making masks mandatory, we're hearing from some Canadians who want to know what qualifies as a mask and if other face coverings will do.

For example, the guidelines in both the city of Toronto and the province of Quebec call for the use of surgical masks, non-medical cloth masks or face coverings, but face shields don't make the cut.

Khysrow A., wrote to us to ask if wearing a religious face covering, like a niqab, would count.

The answer is, it depends.

First, it's important to consult the guidelines in your region to see if a religious face covering is included. But don't be surprised if you can't find any clear directives.

Neither Toronto nor Quebec has posted guidelines that specifically address religious veils. But authorities call for face coverings made of two layers of tightly woven fabric, like cotton, that cover the nose and mouth. Toronto's guidelines say masks should fit snugly, without gaping between the fabric and face.

When asked, Toronto Public Health (TPH) told us that ""both masks and face coverings can be used.""

""The purpose of the mask is to keep your respiratory germs to yourself,"" said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health and a TPH spokesperson.

If your religious face covering doesn't fit snugly, Dubey said you can also wear a mask — but it should go on first, underneath the veil or scarf.

The guidance is similar in Quebec. In an email from Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services, spokesperson Marjorie Larouche said that ""a person who wears a religious sign made of fitted fabric that covers the nose and mouth does not have to wear an additional mask or face covering.""

A niqab is considered a face covering if it covers the nose and mouth, Larouche said. But in the case of a hijab, which doesn't give the same coverage, it ""cannot be considered as protection,"" she said.

Would a religious veil offer the same protection as a mask?

Remember, non-medical masks are intended to protect others from the droplets that spew from our mouths and noses when we cough, sneeze and talk.

A veil's effectiveness would depend on what it was made of, the experts we spoke with said.

WATCH | How to avoid making face mask mistakes:

A face mask is meant to limit the spread of COVID-19. But if it slips below your nose, hovers around your chin, or you touch the outside with your hands, medical experts say that might be riskier than not wearing one at all. 3:55

""Ultimately you want something that's going to filter out particles and act as an effective barrier but also balance out with breathability,"" said Dr. Susy Hota, medical director of infection prevention and control at Toronto's University Health Network.

While Toronto and Quebec both call for a two-layered face covering, Hota pointed out that the World Health Organization suggests three layers.

Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious disease physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, agreed that it comes down to the veil's material.

""If you put something in front of the nose and mouth that is able to block droplets, it'll block droplets,"" said Chagla, who is also an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton.

""A religious garment could theoretically still fit that role.""

The closer the fabrics and materials are to the recommendations set out by public health agencies, the more effective a covering will be, he said.

""Whether or not it has a perfect benefit, that's really based on the material and the way it fits,"" Chagla said.

But even if it's not perfect, it's better than nothing.

Can someone's religion exempt them from wearing a mask?

In Toronto, the answer is yes.

According to the city's bylaw, ""masks are not required by those who require accommodation in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code ,"" said Dubey of TPH.

WATCH | An infectious disease specialist talks about masks:

Quebec's move to impose mask wearing across the province while opening up more is a reasonable trade-off, says infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch. 6:01

The code ""prohibits actions that discriminate against people based on a protected ground in a protected social area.""

Dubey said those who require an accommodation to not wear a mask because of their religion would be protected on the grounds of creed.

The rules are a little different in Quebec, where only certain health conditions qualify for exemptions. And if your religious veil or scarf doesn't cover your mouth and nose, you must still wear a mask, Larouche said, unless you have a health exemption.

What if you're refused entry?

If you wear a religious face covering and are refused service or entry into an establishment because the covering doesn't meet its health guidelines, there are a few things you can do.

Cara Zwibel, a director with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), suggested asking for an accommodation, like ordering online, calling ahead and requesting takeout, for example.

""This would be the same for someone who is exempt with a health issue who can't wear a mask,"" she said.

However, based on the examples of face coverings listed in the guidelines, Zwibel said, a person wearing a religious face covering shouldn't have a problem.

""I do think a person who is wearing a religious face covering would have a good argument in saying my face is covered [and that] I am obeying the rules.""

If you are still being refused and ""all else fails,"" she suggested contacting the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario.

Zwibel also encourages individuals to reach out to the CCLA if they're refused service for wearing a religious face covering.

""We'd also be interested to hear about that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/religious-face-coverings-covid-questions-answered-1.5657670?cmp=rss,news,health,
25163,2020-07-22 4:00,Pandemic creating potential for drug shortages that Canada isn't equipped to deal with,"This column is an opinion by Dr. AbdulGhani Basith, an emergency physician in Toronto and a faculty member at The Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. He is a co-founder of The Critical Drugs Coalition, a group of pharmaceutical experts, physicians and others working to prevent future drug shortages in Canada. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.

For months now, Canadians have been sacrificing things we never thought we would have to and giving up more than we ever thought we could. Those sacrifices are paying off — they've helped flatten the curve, and our hospitals are able to keep up with the burden of this terrible virus.

However, while we have survived this leg of the race, we must recognize that COVID-19 is a marathon that will continue to tax our health care system, and that it is creating the potential for drug shortfalls on a level that we may not be prepared to deal with.

This applies to critical medications as well as potential COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. The federal government needs to publicly and openly take action now to secure our supply of critical care drugs, so that front-line health care providers can continue the work of tending to the sickest patients.

Part of taking care of critically ill people depends on medications that are routinely used in emergency departments and intensive care units all over the world. Medications such as norepinephrine can help support a patient's blood pressure, while others such as propofol and fentanyl help sedate patients on ventilators or undergoing painful procedures.

Without these medications in my ER, we would not have been able to save the life of an otherwise healthy female patient recently whose respiratory system could no longer handle the damage done by COVID-19. We also would not have been able to honour the wishes of an 85-year-old grandmother who was not able to be with her family during her final moments from pneumonia, and who wanted to die with dignity and comfort.

Although these medications are not currently in short supply, the long-term situation is tenuous due to issues with global supply chains as the pandemic rages on.

In fact, over the past few months Canada has had numerous supply issues, many of which have been identified on the Tier 3 drug shortages list run by Health Canada that details those which could have serious consequences for the health care system.

Currently, the vast majority of the drugs on the Tier 3 list (24 of 32) are essential for treating COVID-19. Recently, for example, the drug propofol has had to be imported in non-traditional concentrations. The implications for errors are obvious, and have led to alerts from pharmacists to ensure that physicians are taking care with the new concentrations.

We have also been facing shortages of non-injectable drugs — ventolin (the ""blue puffer"" as it's known to many of our patients) and dexamethasone, a steroid showing tremendous promise for treating the inflammation from COVID-19, being prime examples. Health Canada has been urgently importing ventolin puffers from abroad to fill domestic demand.

Why we face potential shortfalls of these types of drugs is multifaceted. Two of the biggest reasons are the hoarding of drugs by some nations, and the fact that we rely on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with ambiguous supply chains. APIs are the actual precursors for drugs, and their shortage means manufacturers are unable to produce needed drugs in their final form — be it a tablet, an injectable or an inhalable formulary.

Canada relies almost exclusively on imported APIs, and China and India are the leading producers. The supply issues mirror the shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) that we have all become familiar with over the past few months. We relied heavily on China for vital PPE supplies, and when the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed both their own health care and PPE production systems, exports became limited.

Lack of communication

Compounding this is a long-standing lack of information about issues in the global pharmaceutical supply chain.

Drug shortages have been the norm for many years for pharmacists, and they often aren't given advance notice of pending international supply problems. They find out about specific drug shortages only when trying to order more medication from a manufacturer, and are often forced to put together bits and pieces of information as they try to figure out a solution because they aren't privy to the full global supply-chain picture.

This concern has only become worse as COVID-19 limits the export of many drugs from major manufacturers abroad. This is why the Canadian Pharmacist Association placed 30-day limits in March on prescriptions that normally may have gotten 90-day supplies, to ensure all patients would have the medications they needed on a daily basis. This limit is now being lifted as China's API production picks back up.

The federal government has created a website, drugshortages.ca , to help streamline the communication of this kind of information, but many pharmacists feel it is not user-friendly and it does not provide alerts about pending shortages.

Until we have a reliable domestic supply of these types of drugs, the government could achieve better transparency by instituting public policy that mandates disclosure of all aspects of the logistics of API imports.

However, on a global scale the distribution of medications often goes to the highest bidder. With the advent of novel therapies for COVID-19, we are seeing hoarding of some essential medications. Hydroxychloroquine was an early example, and most recently, the U.S. Government purchased 100 per cent of the world's supply of the antiviral drug Remdesivir from Gilead Pharmaceuticals, a medication that may have some benefit for the treatment of COVID-19.

The U.S. has bought the global supply of remdesivir, an antiviral drug that has been found to help certain patients recover more quickly from COVID-19. 4:20

Ideally, many of these critical-care drugs should be part of Canada's National Strategic Emergency Stockpile , but it's clear that we simply do not have enough medications sequestered to meet the demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of this may be due to funding cuts to the maintenance of this stockpile prior to the pandemic. However, it remains that a stockpile is only a temporary measure in the face of a crisis; we need to put systems in place for self-sufficiency around critical health care resources such as the production of important pharmaceuticals.

Unfortunately, Canada is quite limited when it comes to domestic generic drug production. The Sandoz Pharmaceuticals facility in Quebec is the only one in the country that can make injectable drugs, for example, and it is likely not large enough to meet our domestic requirements. Just as we've started producing PPE in Canada, we need to create a stronger domestic drug manufacturing sector.

As a country, we have the knowledge and the skills required to manufacture our own pharmaceuticals, and the payoff for the health care system is well worth it. - Source

Bringing pharmaceutical production back to Canada is not easy, nor would it be without consequence. We should expect to see drug prices increase. But while this is a complicated process, it's not insurmountable. As a country, we have the knowledge and the skills required to manufacture our own pharmaceuticals, and the payoff for the health care system is well worth it.

The lessons of Connaught Labs, the Toronto-based non-profit maker of Frederick Banting's insulin that also made vaccines, are highly applicable today. Connaught Labs was privatized and sold to Sanofi in the '80s. The tragedy of this was aptly described in a recent Toronto Star op-ed , as we could have used Connaught Labs for our domestic COVID-19 vaccine supply today, if not for our drug supply.

Nonetheless, we do have a chance to restore domestic manufacturing now. Government support is essential to doing this successfully, and the Critical Drugs Coalition , which I am a part of, is advocating for this as well as for better stockpiling and increased transparency about the drug supply chain. Domestic manufacturing is the most definitive long-term solution to ensure Canada is not in a position where we are reliant on other countries for necessary medications.

The need to ensure a domestic drug supply also extends to vaccines. Eventually we will have a vaccine for COVID-19, and its distribution will be crucial to rebuilding our economy and restoring normalcy to our daily lives.

Gene-based vaccines, which target DNA or RNA, are being tested on humans in the hopes of finding a COVID-19 vaccine. Researchers are optimistic as trials prove successful so far, but they have a long way to go. 2:01

However, when a vaccine comes to market it will strain supply chains to a degree we haven't seen before. This will be a product that every country will need to restart their respective economies. We cannot afford to be without a robust supply of our own.

The federal government has made investments around research and production of a COVID-19 vaccine, but Canada needs to absolutely ensure we will have the ability to produce vaccines at home. Just as domestic production of APIs allows for self-reliance when global drug shortages occur, the ability to produce vaccines in Canada will also afford us a similar safety net.

We have all lost something during this pandemic, through the innumerable sacrifices made or loved ones who we will never hold again, but we will come out of the crisis stronger. That is who we are as a nation. To ensure our losses and sacrifices haven't been in vain, and to prepare for future crises, we must fix the cracks in our health care system and become self-reliant in developing and supplying our own domestic pharmaceuticals and medical technologies — not only for the Canadians of today, but also for those yet to come.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-pandemic-drug-shortages-1.5604791?cmp=rss,news,opinion,
25164,2020-07-22 4:00,How B.C.'s most vulnerable kids fell into the clutches of a social worker who betrayed them,"Craig cried on the day he learned Kelowna social worker Robert Riley Saunders was a liar. Because it meant his foster son — Stephen — wasn't.

And like dozens of Saunders' young, vulnerable teenage victims, it meant Stephen had been telling the truth years ago when he said he hadn't spent government money provided for his care on drugs.

Stephen is one of at least 102 former foster children covered by a proposed multimillion dollar settlement of a class action lawsuit against B.C.'s Ministry of Children and Family Development and Saunders, who worked as a guardianship social worker from 2001 to 2018. CBC News is not giving Stephen's or Craig's full names so as not to identify children who have been in care.

Craig — who has since stopped being a foster parent — said the cost of Saunders' betrayal is incalculable.

""I bawled. I took this kid into my house and he trusted me, and I screwed him through Riley,"" Craig said.

""It's had a huge impact on these kids. And no one will ever know what impact it's had. Like what if Stephen … what if Riley had actually given him rent and he did get a job?… It's going to affect people for generations.""

'Is it systemic?'

Stephen's story is typical of both a pattern of abuse admitted by the ministry and of deeper concerns about systemic issues that allowed it to happen, according to lawyers and advocates for the victims.

Robert Riley Saunders has never responded to the numerous lawsuits against him. The B.C. Prosecution Service is weighing the possibility of criminal charges against him. (Facebook)

Saunders disappeared from Kelowna when the first of more than a dozen lawsuits were filed against him in B.C. Supreme Court. He has never responded to any of the allegations.

The B.C. prosecution service is reviewing the results of an RCMP investigation which wrapped up this spring to determine if he should be charged criminally.

But advocates and lawyers involved in the case say it would be a mistake to concentrate only on the actions of one man without shining a spotlight on the system he worked within.

According to court documents, Saunders faked a bachelors' degree in social work. He was warned about a conflict of fiduciary interest. And performance reviews suggested he could be seen to be ""disinterested or not show appropriate sensitivity to Aboriginal culture/history.""

And yet he was trusted in a role that made him a de facto parent for children in the care of the state. And the vast majority of his victims — 85 of the 102 identified in the class action — were Indigenous.

""Is the fact that these kids were Aboriginal the reason why he was able to do what he did with confidence, knowing that he's operating in a system that will not bat an eyelid as to what is happening with the most vulnerable of the population?"" asks Michael Patterson, a lawyer represents numerous individual victims suing Saunders.

""Is it systemic?""

'We let him down'

Stephen, who is Métis, entered the foster care system when he was six.

According to court documents, he left Craig's foster home when he was 17 and went into an independent living situation, with Saunders supposedly providing him money for rent and other necessities.

But Saunders allegedly took that money for himself.

At least 102 young victims have been identified as part of the lawsuit. Many say they became homeless because Robert Riley Saunders stole their rent money. (bchomeless.com)

And when people like Craig — who loves Stephen as a son — asked questions, Craig said Saunders assured them the kids were to blame.

""You trust Riley because he has a degree, and he's really smart, and he's really smooth,"" said Craig.

""These kids. They don't have anybody. Stephen had us, and we let him down.""

Stephen, who is now 28, said he never liked Saunders.

""There's a lot of s--- I got blamed for that I didn't do and I got in s--- for. And they wonder as I was growing up as a kid — they wonder why we didn't like social workers,"" Stephen said.

""They set us up to fail.""

'This is unacceptable'

In a statement, B.C.'s Ministry of Children and Family Development said there is systemic racism in the child welfare system.

""To what extent racism played a role in this case, we can't say for certain,"" the ministry said. ""But we are taking the steps to make sure that there is support and fair compensation for people who are affected and to prevent it from happening again.""

A proposed settlement to a B.C. Supreme Class Action lawsuit would see Robert Riley Saunders' victims get a base sum of $25,000. The total could rise to $250,000 depending on their situation. (David Horemans/CBC)

The proposed settlement would provide $25,000 for anyone who was in Saunders' care for 90 days or more with an additional $44,000 for Indigenous claimants.

Victims can then apply for up to $181,000 in additional damages related to physical abuse, sexual exploitation, homelessness and loss of education. A decision on whether the settlement is approved is expected next week.

The ministry said it has tightened financial controls and is working to see First Nations exercise greater jurisdiction over child and family services.

""For too long, system wide assumptions and practices have failed Indigenous children, families and communities,"" the ministry said.

""This is unacceptable.""

'They were worth more'

Cheryl Casimer is on the political executive of the First Nations Summit, a group that addresses issues concerning B.C. First Nations and tribal councils.

She supports an inquiry into racism in the foster care system — if it can happen without re-traumatizing the victims. She also wants to see criminal charges against Saunders.

""We've done too much talking already,"" Casimer said.

""We've wasted a lot of time talking. We need to get some action.""

Cheryl Casimer, with the political executive of the First Nations Summit, says she wants to see criminal charges against Robert Riley Saunders. (CBC)

Patterson, the lawyer, said his clients are ""baffled"" by how long police and prosecutors have taken to make a decision on charges, because many of Saunders' victims have been charged and jailed over the most petty offences.

B.C.'s Representative for Children and Youth Jennifer Charlesworth finds the case troubling — not just in its details, but in what it reveals about young people let down by a state that was supposed to protect them.

""I suspect that many of the young people didn't feel like they would get anywhere if they raised their concerns,"" she says.

""And they didn't know that they were worth more.""

'We're not lying'

Craig is a second-generation foster parent. His mother took in kids, and he fostered for two decades.

""There's lots of problems with the foster care system,"" he said.

""But I think we have a bunch of good people that are trying to make it as good as they can. And I think Riley was a wake-up call for all of them.""

Stephen has struggled for years with addiction to drugs like crack. He is trying to stay clean and be positive with the goal of using any money he gets from a settlement to obtain the necessary qualifications to assist troubled youth.

His biggest hope is that Saunders' past lies will make it easier for future foster kids to be believed.

""Maybe they'll listen to what foster kids are saying,"" he said. ""(And they'll think) we're not lying.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/robert-riley-saunders-racism-foster-children-1.5657581?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
25165,2020-07-22 4:00,Military intelligence unit briefed Sajjan on COVID-19 risk on January 17: documents,"A little-known medical unit within Canadian Forces Intelligence Command briefed Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan about the COVID-19 crisis on January 17, 2020, the government confirmed in a document presented to Parliament this week.

The briefing from the medical intelligence (MEDINT) unit came 17 days after the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province.

Between December 31, 2019 and January 3, 2020, 44 patients with an unknown form of ""pneumonia"" were reported to the WHO by authorities in China. Thousands more such cases would follow in the days ahead.

While the minister was briefed in mid-January about the new virus, the government's incident response group — led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and composed of cabinet ministers and other senior governmental officials — didn't meet to discuss COVID-19 until 10 days later, on January 27.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens to a question with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Health Patty Hajdu, Chief Medical Officer Theresa Tam, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau and President of the Treasury Board Jean-Yves Duclos during a news conference on the pandemic in Ottawa on March 11, 2020. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

By that date, 82 people had died and more than 2,800 cases had been confirmed in mainland China. More cases were being reported throughout the rest of Asia and around the world.

In response to an order paper question from Conservative MP James Bezan, the Department of National Defence confirmed that the medical intelligence unit shared its briefing documents about COVID-19 widely with other government departments and agencies.

""All relevant information and analysis was briefed to senior officials in a timely manner ... The minister of National Defence receives regular briefings to ensure the safety and security of Canadians as well as Canadian Armed Forces members at home and abroad,"" DND said in its response to Bezan.

While the actual contents of that military intelligence briefing are unknown, it is clear that the machinery of government was aware of COVID-19 and its spread well before the Public Health Agency of Canada coordinated an almost complete shutdown of economic and social life two months later, in mid-March.

A not-so-early warning

Wesley Wark, a University of Ottawa professor and one of the country's top intelligence experts, said the delay between the January 17 military briefing and the first meeting of the incident response group shows ""there weren't a lot of alarm bells ringing anywhere in government"" in the early days of this pandemic.

Wark said the January 17 briefing to Sajjan on the threat posed by COVID-19 to Canada ""wasn't particularly early,"" given China was already in the planning stages for the full lockdown of Hubei province that took place less than a week later.

By the time cabinet and officials met on January 27, Wark said, Western intelligence agencies had already known for weeks that there was a new virus ripping through Hubei province and beyond.

CBC asked Sajjan's office about the intelligence report and the subsequent 10-day delay before an incident response group meeting on COVID-19. ""We do not comment on specific intelligence reports,"" a spokesperson for Sajjan said.

""Our government and the Canadian Armed Forces are committed to health and safety of Canadians. Since the start of the pandemic, we have monitored the progression of the outbreak to ensure the protection of Canadians and Members of the Canadian Armed Forces,"" Floriane Bonneville said in an email statement to CBC News.

In the order paper question response, DND confirmed that Canada's military and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) were working with Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership, and with NATO and NORAD intelligence partners, to monitor the outbreak.

The U.S. military's National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) was following and reporting on the novel coronavirus as early as last November, with its analysts warning U.S. officials and allies of a ""cataclysmic event.""

I think we have to assume that the wasted time cost Canada enormously in terms of lives and, as economists say in a bloody-minded way, treasure. - Wesley Wark

""Canada, for reasons that go unexplained, missed the opportunity to do proper risk assessments, to seize the opportunity of early warning and to get the response planning into gear,"" Wark said.

""We lost a crucial period of time to take preparations before COVID-19 seriously struck in Canada. I think we have to assume that the wasted time cost Canada enormously in terms of lives and, as economists say in a bloody-minded way, treasure.""

It is not clear how, or if, the military's January 17 intelligence briefing differed from other reports that were being prepared by the lead government agency on COVID-19, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

""There's two ways to read it — if red flags were raised they were not red flags that were taken seriously, or there weren't really red flags raised at that stage,"" Wark said.

The PHAC was working closely with its partners at the WHO, which has since been criticized for being too closely aligned with the Communist regime in Beijing.

The Associated Press has reported, based on leaked documents, that China's leaders sat on critical information that might have helped stave off a global pandemic.

'Our early warning system failed'

What is known is that the contents of the January briefing to Sajjan did not lead the federal government to close borders or restrict flights — or to alter its public messaging on the risk the virus posed to Canadians.

""Thousands of travellers were streaming through Canadian airports — none of whom were quarantined — and nobody seemed to be lifting an eyebrow,"" Wark said of the two-month stretch between intelligence briefing and the shutdown.

As previously reported by CBC, based on documents presented at the House of Commons health committee, much of the government's focus in the early days of the pandemic was on repatriating Canadians from Hubei province and cruise ships while international borders remained open with minimal screening.

""The reality is we missed the significance of COVID-19. Our early warning system failed and our risk assessments were totally wrong and we've got to fix that as soon as possible,"" Wark said.

As late as March 10, a department-drafted briefing note prepared for Health Minister Patty Hajdu ahead of question period was saying that — with just 12 cases being reported nationwide at that point (even though publicly available numbers already had climbed higher) — ""the risk of spread of this virus within Canada remains low at this time.""

The note also said the public health system is ""well-equipped to contain cases coming from abroad, limiting the spread in Canada.""

A month later, Canada would have more than 21,000 cases, many of them linked to China, Europe and U.S. travel.

As government documents show, as of Jan. 28 the World Health Organization (WHO) was describing the risk of COVID-19 transmission as ""very high"" in China and ""high at the global level.""

It would be weeks before Canadian public health officials changed their risk assessment.

""There's a lot of explaining that I think the Canadian government needs to do as to why it held on to a low risk judgment for so long until suddenly, on a Sunday in mid-March, we got all these cascading, desperate measures and societal restrictions,"" Wark said.

Trudeau and other members of his cabinet have been reluctant to publicly look back at what could have been done to better prepare Canada for COVID-19 with the country still in the grips of a pandemic.

Since mid-March, much of the government's focus has been on mitigating the spread of the virus and supporting Canadians through unprecedented job losses and economic decline.

""As we look back, of course there's going to be things we said, 'Oh, we might have said this differently or that differently,'"" Trudeau said in April when asked about the speed of the government's response.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/military-intelligence-unit-covid-19-briefing-1.5657796?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25166,2020-07-22 4:00,Pushback against sexual harassment in the gaming industry grows with high-profile resignations,"Montreal-based designer Tanya X. Short has been in the gaming industry for over a decade. She remembers what it was like starting out in a company as one of the few women in the room.

""I had internalized so many things as completely normal. But it took me many years to realize that there were uncomfortable assumptions being made; that I was subconsciously altering my behaviour,"" said Short.

Accord to a 2019 study from the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, the gaming industry contributes $4.5 billion to Canada's GDP annually. But as lucrative as the business is, in the past few weeks an ugly side to the industry has emerged with a wave of women sharing stories of harassment and mistreatment.

These stories paint a picture of toxic workplaces where allegations of sexual harassment are commonplace. Some of the stories have involved one of Canada's biggest gaming employers, Ubisoft.

The Paris-based company was the focus of a report from the gaming news site Kotaku containing disturbing allegations of sexual harassment in the Toronto office. Other reports soon followed.

On June 11, Yannis Mallat, president of Ubisoft Canada, resigned. In Paris, Serge Hascoet, the company's chief creative officer, and Cecile Cornet, the global head of human resources, stepped down. In Toronto, Maxime Beland, the vice-president of editorial, resigned and an unnamed employee was fired.

A new #Metoo moment in gaming

The accounts emerging from Ubisoft are part of a larger moment in the gaming community. For weeks now on the Twitch streaming site, community members and players have been sharing stories of sexual assault and harassment. One streamer went so far as to create a spreadsheet to track all the accusations and responses.

Montreal's Marie-Michelle Pepin is a character artist, who creates 3D models of characters for video games. She joined the chorus of voices in late June posting on Twitter a thread about being objectified and intimidated when she began her career. ""I even wondered if I picked the wrong industry,"" she told CBC News.

Let's talk about some shit I've either experience myself or seen happening to others while working <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#gamedev</a><br><br>I've been told many time that the only reasons I have gotten a job was either to fill some women quotas for the company, or to become an eye candy for the male staff<br>.... —@Marie_M_P

University of British Columbia professor Jennifer Jenson studies gender and the gaming industry. She connects the new wave of allegations to the wider protests against anti-Black racism and the push for Indigenous rights.

""I think it opened this space for people to be able to talk about the harms that they have experienced in a way that wasn't available before,"" she said.

Already, a critical mass of voices is pushing companies to respond.

Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot addressed the accusations in a post titled, ""Change starts today"" where he wrote about transforming Ubisoft's human resources processes and improving manager accountability.

Tanya X. Short (middle) has been in the gaming industry for over a decade. Above she poses with the co-founders of her company KitFox Games, Jongwoo Kim and Xin Ran Liu. (Kitfox Games)

But Tanya X. Short, now CEO of her own indie game studio Kitfox Games in Montreal, said victims can't always look to human resources departments for help.

""I can tell you that no matter the size of a corporation HR is always there to protect the company and they are almost legally obligated to their shareholders to calculate the value of the harasser versus the victim,"" she said.

CBC News asked to speak with Ubisoft Canada about the recent allegations and reports on workplace culture. Ubisfot said they had no further comment while investigations are ongoing.

Jenson said the dismissals are just scratching the surface.

The problem, she suggests, is a workplace culture that hasn't kept pace with the changing demographics of the audience. As the customer base for video games becomes more diverse, a 2019 survey from the U.S.-based International Game Developers Association found only 24 per cent of development staff identified as female.

The stock market punished Ubisoft following news of the resignations and Short said the industry is slowly starting to realize safer and more equitable work environments make for better results.

She points to conversations around crunch, the gaming industry practice of pushing employees to meet deadlines with long stretches of overtime and few breaks.

Ten years ago, many people in the industry saw crunch as a necessary part of the business. Today, she said the industry is talking about it publicly and viewpoints are changing.

Short hopes the same will be the case for toxic and hostile behaviour around women and employees from marginalized genders working in game development.

As a member of Pixelles, a group dedicated to helping women in the industry, Short said many barriers put females at a disadvantage, such as the lack of flexible work schedules.

Structural changes

While CEOs of major companies talk about addressing the allegations by making fundamental changes, finding a way forward won't necessarily be easy, Jenson said.

""Everyone has to start almost from scratch,"" she said. ""They need all kinds of things, starting with education. That creates opportunities for growth and change that aren't present.""

Short said larger studios might be tempted to just do some public relations work in order to avoid as little structural change as possible.

That's why she said conversations around unionization in game developer circles are getting louder. In an industry where some employees don't feel they can turn to HR, Short said they need to turn to each other.

""Unions are not beholden to the shareholders of the company; they are concerned with you as a person. That's the best way forward for employees to band together and really find justice together,"" she said.

25168,2020-07-22 4:00,NWSL Challenge Cup's stunning quarter-finals pave way for wild finish,"A spot in the championship is on the line when the NWSL Challenge Cup semifinals get underway Wednesday in Utah — and if the matches are anything like the quarters, soccer fans will be entertained.

Whether it's seeing the top three seeds ousted from the tournament, including the two-time defending champion North Carolina Courage, or three games decided by penalty kicks, anything can happen in a knockout format.

There's bound to be more surprises before Sunday's final at Rio Tinto Stadium.

Here's what you should know about the upcoming semifinals:

Portland Thorns (No. 8) vs. Houston Dash (No. 4)

Canadians to watch: Portland's Christine Sinclair (F, Burnaby, B.C.); Houston's Allysha Chapman (D, Courtice, Ont.), Nichelle Prince (F, Ajax, Ont.), Sophie Schmidt (MF, Abbotsford, B.C.), Meaghan Kelly (F, Kansas City, Mo.)

The Thorns were the only winless team in the preliminary round, but all it took was a Morgan Weaver goal in the 68th minute to stun the previously unbeaten North Carolina Courage. Britt Eckerstrom, the team's third-string goalkeeper, started her first game of the tournament in place of injured Bella Bixby and enjoyed an outstanding outing.

International soccer's all-time leading scorer Sinclair (186 goals in 296 matches for Canada) hasn't shown her usual penchant around goal as of yet, but as captain she played an important role mentoring Weaver and fellow rookie Sophia Smith, who's currently injured. Midfielders Rocky Rodriguez (Costa Rica) and Lindsay Horan (U.S.) have been standouts. Horan, who scored this remarkable goal in the preliminary round, is nursing a hip injury. Veteran defender Meghan Klingenberg has been key on set pieces.

Outside of a rough outing against Sky Blue (2-0 loss), Houston has been one of the surprises of the tournament. After finishing seventh in the 2019 season, the team retooled its lineup and gelled quickly in the Challenge Cup.

WATCH | Thorns stun Courage en route to semis:

Morgan Weaver scored in the 68th minute to send the Portland Thorns into the semifinals of the NWSL's Challenge Cup with a surprising 1-0 upset over the two-time defending league champion North Carolina Courage. 1:10

Rachel Daly (three goals) and Shea Groom (two goals) have given the Dash an 1-2 offensive punch, while the centreback combo of Katie Naughton and Megan Oyster are about as tight as they come, though Oyster's status is questionable after suffering a fractured rib last game. Keeper Jane Campbell had a rocky game against Sky Blue, but showed why she's one of the premier shot stoppers in the NWSL in denying two Utah penalties in the quarters.

As for the Canadians on the Dash, left back Chapman has played 90 minutes in four out of five games, Sophie Schmidt is soaking up significant minutes in midfield and Nichelle Prince earned her first start up front in the quarter-finals after being used mostly as a substitute.

Sky Blue (No. 7) vs. Chicago Red Stars (No. 6)

Canadians to watch: Sky Blue's Kailen Sheridan (GK, Whitby, Ont.), Evelyne Viens (F, L'ancienne-Lorette, Que.); Chicago's Bianca St. Georges (St-Charles-Borommée, Que.)

This is a battle between teams with arguably the best two top goalkeepers in the league.

There were more than a few question marks about Sky Blue FC heading into the Challenge Cup, especially given that three key players were unavailable due to injury (Carli Lloyd, Mallory Pugh, Caprice Dydasco), but they seem to have found their groove as the tournament has moved along.

McCall Zerboni's leadership in the midfield can't be overstated. Traded from the Courage in the off-season, the 34-year-old has been a workhorse and it's rubbed off on everyone around her. If you've watched any of their games, Jennifer Cudjoe has probably caught your eye. The midfielder made the team through an open tryout — a rarity — and will likely earn more than just her current short-term contract after the Challenge Cup is over.

Much of the team's success has come via sure-handed Canadian goalkeeper Sheridan. She's allowed just three goals in five games, posted three clean sheets and stopped a key penalty in Sky Blue's quarter-final upset over Washington. She's been one of the team's leaders, helping to organize the backs as well as making those key saves.

WATCH | Sheridan leads Blue past Spirit:

Kailen Sheridan of Whitby, Ont., made the game-ending save as her Sky Blue FC advanced to the NWSL Challenge Cup semis with a 4-3 win on penalties over the Washington Spirit. 7:05

Chicago — a finalist last season — scored just two goals in the preliminary round, but thanks to workhorse fullbacks Julie Ertz (a tournament MVP candidate) and Casey Short, as well as U.S. national team goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, opposing teams have their work cut out for them.

However, if they want to get back to the championship game, scoring during the run of play and not relying on a stalwart defensive line would help. Through five games, the Red Stars recorded just 30 shots (third fewest in the league) with only 10 on goal (last).

In her first NWSL season, St. Georges hasn't looked out of place, starting in three games including the quarter-final. She was drafted 20th overall by Chicago in 2019, but missed all of last season after knee surgery.

25149,2020-07-22 3:42,"Gov. Gen. Payette has created a toxic climate of harassment and verbal abuse at Rideau Hall, sources allege","Gov. Gen. Julie Payette has created a toxic environment at Rideau Hall by verbally harassing employees to the point where some have been reduced to tears or have left the office altogether, sources tell CBC News.

Four members of Payette's communications team have departed during the pandemic period alone. A fifth person is leaving this week and another two have taken leaves of absence. It's just the latest wave of staff to quietly transfer out of the small office in response to mistreatment during Payette's mandate, multiple sources said.

""This has gone from being one of the most collegial and enjoyable work environments for many of the staff to being a house of horrors,"" said one government source. ""It's bullying and harassment at its worst.""

CBC News spoke to a dozen sources with direct knowledge of the office during Payette's mandate. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared they could lose their jobs or their careers could suffer. Many of the sources are still in the public service, while others are former Rideau Hall employees.

The sources say Payette has yelled at, belittled and publicly humiliated employees. They accuse her of throwing tantrums in the office and, on one occasion, tossing an employee's work aside and calling it ""shit.""

On a single day, multiple people were seen leaving Payette's office with tears in their eyes after private meetings with the Governor General, said one source. In another instance, a staff member was spotted crying in their car.

""She screams and humiliates staff in front of others,"" said a former employee. ""It's verbal abuse. In no world is it OK to treat people that way.""

Payette's secretary and longtime friend, Assunta Di Lorenzo, is also accused of harassing employees and calling some ""lazy"" and ""incompetent.""

""[Di Lorenzo is] also a bully,"" said a source. ""When confronted with something she's unsure of, instead of giving you the benefit of the doubt, she comes at you as a pit bull.""

Reporting in 'stark contrast' to reality, says Rideau Hall

In a statement issued to CBC News, Rideau Hall said Payette and the management of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General ""strongly"" believe ""in the importance of a healthy workplace, we have taken many steps to foster this, we will continue to do so and will work at constantly improving.""

""We deeply regret this reporting, which is in stark contrast to the reality of working at the OSGG, and obscures the important work done by our dedicated staff in honouring, representing, and showcasing Canadians,"" said Ashlee Smith, press secretary to the Governor General.

The Prime Minister's Office said all Canadians have to work in a ""healthy, respectful and safe environment,"" but referred CBC's questions to Rideau Hall.

""Our government is committed to ensuring that all federally-regulated workplaces are free from harassment of any kind,"" said PMO press secretary Ann-Clara Vaillancourt.

Payette's trailblazing career

Payette was appointed Governor General on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October 2017. She is just over half way through her mandate, which will end in October 2022 if it's not extended.

Payette is a Montreal-born trailblazer — a former astronaut who's been to space twice and is also a computer engineer, pilot, academic, musician and executive.

Although Payette's role as the Queen's representative in Canada is mostly ceremonial, the vice-regal position can be an important one in a minority government situation. Payette is bound by constitutional convention to follow the advice of the prime minister if the PM requests a dissolution or prorogation of Parliament, but she is empowered to dismiss a government that has been defeated on a vote of confidence if it refuses to step aside.

The National Post has written extensively about Payette's struggle to adapt to her new public role. The newspaper reported that Payette is a deeply private person who is involved in the minutia of administration, has pushed back against protocol and has cut down her workload.

Rideau Hall among the worst in public service for harassment

As reported by Maclean's magazine, the 2019 federal Public Service Employee Survey said that 22 per cent of respondents working for Rideau Hall claimed to have experienced harassment, down from 25 per cent in 2018 — still the third-highest harassment level reported by any federal department or agency.

The annual survey offers the only publicly available data on the extent of harassment in the bureaucracy.

In 2019, just over one-in-five of the 126 Rideau Hall employees who responded to the survey reported having been victims of harassment on the job over a 12-month period.

Of those Rideau Hall employees who reported harassment, 74 per cent attributed it to individuals with authority over them.

Half of the 28 self-reported victims said they were humiliated, 47 per cent reported dealing with someone exerting excessive control, 40 per cent felt excluded or ignored, and 44 per cent said they dealt with aggressive behaviour.

""These are not one-time issues,"" said a government source. ""This is a constant assault upon those who work in and around and for the Governor General, Madame Payette.

""It's beyond anything that a public servant or anyone working for an institution should have to endure.""

Humiliating huddles on planes

The people who report directly to Payette — managers, the communications team, those involved in programming and those who travel with Payette — bear the brunt of the harassment, said many sources. Pantry workers and NCC maintenance staff also have been left visibly upset or shaken after being questioned directly by Payette.

In one four-month period, roughly two dozen people reported abusive conduct by Payette or Di Lorenzo to management, according to government sources.

The harassment often happens on a one-to-one basis; any specific examples reported by CBC News could be traced back to sources. But sources have described broader patterns in Payette's alleged behaviour toward staff.

Watch: Allegations of bullying and harrassment in Gov. Gen. Julie Payette's office:

There has been an exodus of employees from Gov. Gen. Julie Payette’s Rideau Hall office because of a culture of bullying and harassment, CBC News has learned. 2:15

Part of Payette's job is to attend state visits around the world to meet with dignitaries and build on Canada's international ties. Sources claim that travel brings out the worst in Payette. Multiple sources described the Governor General routinely complaining of being tired, underfed and overworked.

Sources say Payette often uses flights home from trips abroad to criticize staff in front of their peers over what she sees as their shortcomings. Payette frequently asks staff members to huddle around her on the plane for a debriefing, then verbally attacks employees over what she considers to be poor work, said sources.

Several sources said such in-flight debriefs can last hours. Employees have been seen crying in their vehicles on the way home, said sources.

""When you see people in tears, something is not right,"" a former employee told CBC.

Sources say Payette is known for dropping what they call ""explosions,"" ""tantrums"" or ""bursts of emotion"" on staff at Rideau Hall. Such outbursts are often centred around Payette being upset with the quality of someone's work and the belief that she has to do everything herself because everyone else is incompetent.

""She needs to control absolutely everything,"" said one government source. ""If things don't go the way she wants it to go, she needs to find someone responsible for it.""

'A victim at every meeting'

During meetings with staff, sources said, Payette has been known to ""grill"" employees on files unrelated to the meeting topic.

""There was always that level of criticism and I would say in almost every meeting somebody was berated,"" said one former employee. ""There was, I'll go as far to say, a victim at every meeting.""

At the beginning of her mandate, sources said, Payette also put staff on the spot by quizzing them about outer space — asking them to name all the planets in the solar system, for example, or to state the distance between the sun and the moon.

""She loves these gotcha moments,"" said one government source. ""She's just smarter than you and she likes to let you know that.""

Most sources said Payette often makes decisions with the help of a very small inner circle that includes Di Lorenzo.

A former lawyer and executive in Montreal, Di Lorenzo is supposed to keep Payette's office running smoothly and effectively. Multiple sources said Di Lorenzo is struggling more than two years into the job — which is typically filled by a seasoned public servant — and still doesn't understand how the public service works.

The government had to create an entirely new position to assist Di Lorenzo — an associate secretary who is a veteran public servant.

Sources said Di Lorenzo has been seen yelling at Rideau Hall workers and claiming that she has to do everything for everyone.

""The way [Di Lorenzo] spoke to people was really harsh,"" said a former employee. ""It was like a punch every time she spoke to someone. She wasn't a team player. She gets over-involved and tries to do everyone's jobs for them but doesn't know what she's doing.""

""They will bully you until you either agree or leave,"" said a government source. ""It's bullying and harassment at its worst.""

High staff turnover

Di Lorenzo has had at least four executive assistants, according to sources in the public service. Payette has rotated through three executive assistants during her time at Rideau Hall — including one who served three past governors-general.

Five executives also left Payette's office in 2018 within a three-month period over their treatment on the job, sources said.

""It's just very clear everybody was afraid to speak up,"" said one former employee.

One worker who left Rideau Hall citing harassment said the job wasn't worth the damage it did to their self-worth.

""It's not just a matter of bad workplace dynamics,"" said the source. ""There's actual harassment and abuse ... It was just so tense that ... I almost just wanted to hide the whole time I was there.

""Life's too short. I don't want to come to work in the morning and spend the day feeling like I'm going to cry or not feeling like I could speak up.""

In the statement to CBC News, the Governor General's press secretary said Rideau Hall has a lower than average employee turnover rate when compared to other federal departments.

""Our staff take great pride in their work and enjoy a challenging and dynamic workplace,"" said Smith.

""In fact, the OSGG has a lower-than-average employee turnover when compared to other federal departments. One of the benefits of the federal public service is that individuals have the ability to move across different departments, seek promotions, and gain new and valuable career experiences, something that is personally encouraged by the Governor General, who believes that career growth and opportunity are vitally important.""

One source defended Payette, saying she has high standards and had reasons for her disappointment in staff. The source said Payette has approached the job on a much more personal level than past governors general, citing her decision to bike with the public on Canada Day in defiance of typical safety protocols.

The Globe and Mail has reported Payette has been at odds with the RCMP over security measures in the past.

A lack of oversight and safeguards

The harassment claims raise questions about the degree of oversight and accountability at Rideau Hall. The office benefits from Crown privileges and is exempt from access to information laws.

Like other federal employees, the Governor General's staff members can talk in confidence to an ombudsman with Public Services Procurement Canada. But it's not part of the ombudsman's mandate to register complaints or launch investigations. At most, the ombudsman can raise issues to the most senior person within the department — in this case, Di Lorenzo.

Employees can turn to Rideau Hall's own human resources office, but it's a closed loop: the complaints go to Di Lorenzo, who reports to the Governor General.

""It's soul-destroying,"" said one source. ""There's no one to complain to. There's no recourse. There's no one to report to without getting yourself into a reasonable amount of trouble or potentially losing your job.""

Payette's press secretary defended Rideau Hall's HR process and said no formal complaints regarding harassment have been made.

""We are proud of our stringent internal processes for our employees to voice concerns, through the staffing of a robust and accessible human resources department, an independent ombudsman, in addition to maintaining excellent relationships with the unions that represent our employees, whom have additional processes for the protection and support of federal public servants,"" said Smith.

Sources who spoke with the CBC said, however, that in some cases managers have told staff there isn't anything they can do about the harassment because they're victims of that same harassment.

Philippe Lagassé, an associate professor at Carleton University and an expert on the Westminster parliamentary system, said Canadians would benefit from greater transparency in vice regal offices like Rideau Hall.

""That's a long-standing issue that we've had,"" he said.

In fact, he said, the one person who could intervene and talk to Payette about human resource matters is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""The prime minister is responsible and accountable for all acts of the Governor General and everything that happens at Rideau Hall,"" said Lagassé.

""If there is concern about how the office is operating, that would have to come from the prime minister to the Governor General and a remedy would be found between them and their offices.""

Full text of the statement from the office of the Governor General:

The Governor General and the management of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General (OSGG) strongly believe in the importance of a healthy workplace, we have taken many steps to foster this, we will continue to do so and will work at constantly improving. We deeply regret this reporting, which is in stark contrast to the reality of working at the OSGG, and obscures the important work done by our dedicated staff in honouring, representing, and showcasing Canadians.



We take these matters very seriously, and we are proud of our stringent internal processes for our employees to voice concerns, through the staffing of a robust and accessible human resources department, an independent ombudsman, in addition to maintaining excellent relationships with the unions that represent our employees, whom have additional processes for the protection and support of federal public servants. Since the beginning of the mandate, no formal complaint regarding harassment has been made through any of these channels.



Our staff take great pride in their work, and enjoy a challenging and dynamic workplace. In fact, the OSGG has a lower than average employee turnover when compared to other federal departments. One of the benefits of the federal public service is that individuals have the ability to move across different departments, seek promotions, and gain new and valuable career experiences, something that is personally encouraged by the Governor General, who believes that career growth and opportunity are vitally important.

25159,2020-07-22 1:47,Lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell seeks gag order in case,"A lawyer for financier Jeffrey Epstein's ex-girlfriend on Tuesday asked a judge presiding over her sex crimes case to impose a gag order on lawyers and others to reduce prejudicial pretrial publicity and protect her chances of a fair trial.

The attorney, Jeffrey Pagliuca, filed a letter in Manhattan federal court citing public comments made by Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, the head of New York's FBI office and lawyers for accusers of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell after her July 2 arrest in Bradford, New Hampshire.

He said the comments show that an order is necessary to prevent ""prejudicial pretrial publicity by the government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.""

In particular, he cited comments at a news conference by William Sweeney, head of New York's FBI office, that referenced Maxwell as ""one of the villains in this investigation"" and compared her to a snake that ""slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire.""

Prosecutors declined through a spokesperson to comment on the gag order request.

The request came on the same day that publicity in Maxwell's favour came during a White House news conference when President Donald Trump was asked about her and said: ""I just wish her well, frankly.""

Trump also said of Maxwell: ""I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well.""

Denied bail

Maxwell, 58, pleaded not guilty last week to charges that she recruited three girls, one as young as 14, in the 1990s for Epstein to sexually abuse during massage sessions she sometimes participated in at his Manhattan mansion and in Palm Beach, Florida; Santa Fe, New Mexico, and London.

Epstein, 66, took his life last August at a Manhattan federal jail while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges related to the sexual abuse of girls and women in Manhattan and Florida in the early 2000s.

Maxwell was ordered held without bail until a July 2021 trial by Judge Alison J. Nathan.

On Tuesday, Nathan issued a written order saying she had received a ""significant number of letters and messages from non-parties that purport to be related to this case."" She called them ""procedurally improper or irrelevant"" to the judicial proceedings and said they would be ignored.

At a bail hearing last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe argued against bail by saying Maxwell had been less than forthcoming when she was interviewed by Pretrial Services.

""In addition to failing to describe in any way the absence of proposed cosigners of a bond, the defendant also makes no mention whatsoever about the financial circumstances or assets of her spouse whose identity she declined to provide,"" Moe said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/maxwell-epstein-trial-1.5658391?cmp=rss,news,world,

25201,2020-07-22 0:51,2 U.S. boaters in B.C. waters fined under Quarantine Act,"The RCMP says two U.S. boaters have been fined after officers with its Pacific Shiprider program located them in Canadian waters, allegedly in contravention of the Quarantine Act.

The first case involved a boater on July 10 who, according to RCMP, claimed to be heading to Alaska. The police allege the person had entered Canada for the purpose of tourism.

According to a statement released by B.C. RCMP's Federal Serious and Organized Crime Unit, the person was fined $1,000 under Section 58 of the Quarantine Act.

""Boaters are not allowed within Canadian territorial or boundary waters for discretionary, leisure (non-essential) reasons, including touring, sightseeing and pleasure fishing,"" the statement read.

A second fine was issued July 17, after police found a U.S. whale watching operator and his passengers in Canadian waters. The alleged offence was the same as the July 10 case.

""Boaters found illegally within Canadian waters may face severe penalties, including fines, seizure of their vessels and/or criminal charges,"" said the statement.

Quarantine Act offences could result in six months in prison and up to $750,000 in fines. Anyone who causes a risk of imminent death or serious injury to someone else while willfully or recklessly contravening the Quarantine Act could face more serious consequences — up to $1,000,000 in fines and three years in prison.

25154,2020-07-22 0:44,Philippine journalist Maria Ressa pleads not-guilty to tax evasion,"Award-winning Philippine journalist Maria Ressa, who was last month convicted of libel in what was widely criticized as an attack on press freedom, on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to tax evasion, one of several other cases she and her online news site are facing.

Ressa, who heads Rappler Inc., told reporters outside a Manila court that ""we have to hold the line every step of the way,"" referring to her defence.

She said she pleaded not guilty during her arraignment on a charge of tax code violation related to Rappler's VAT return for the 2nd quarter of 2015. In April 2019, Ressa pleaded not guilty to four other tax violation charges before the Court of Tax Appeals, which consisted of one count of tax evasion and three counts of failure to supply correct tax information.

Ressa, who worked for CNN and was one of Time magazine's Persons of the Year in 2018, has accused the government of President Rodrigo Duterte of abusing its power and using the law to muzzle dissent.

Last month, a Manila court found Ressa and a former Rappler reporter guilty of libelling a wealthy businessman. Ressa was sentenced to up to six years but her lawyer said the prison terms and other penalties imposed could not be enforced unless all appeals were rejected.

Duterte and other Philippine officials have said the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler were not a press freedom issue but part of judicial procedures arising from their alleged violations of the law.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/journalist-philippines-duterte-1.5658382?cmp=rss,news,world,
25167,2020-07-22 0:06,Here's why COVID-19 cases have tripled in B.C. but officials aren't panicking,"First, the bad news.

Cases of COVID-19 in B.C. are at a level they haven't been at for months. They've tripled in the last two weeks, as a series of outbreaks at parties and restaurants and hospitals have seen the count go from around 10 a day to around 30.

""We are at a turning point,"" said Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry on Monday.

""The number of new cases over the last few days is concerning … there are a few things we need to do to push that curve back down.""

But despite the surge in numbers, there are a number of reasons why the provincial government isn't breaking the panic glass and grabbing the proverbial fire extinguisher.

Part of the reason, of course, is that stern orders and social media shaming has never been part of Henry's playbook — not when daily cases were around 60 a day, and not when they were around 10.

However, there are a few other indicators why the curve could be flattened with a few corrections.

It's young people, and it's Kelowna

To start with, the surge of COVID-19 isn't equally distributed across British Columbia.

The number of daily positive tests in the Lower Mainland has slowly inched up in the last two weeks, from around 10 a day at the beginning of July to around 15.

But after two months of rarely having a positive test — and a period of time where there were no active cases at all — areas outside the Lower Mainland have experienced an explosion in the number of COVID-19 cases, going from five to 86 over a two-week period.

Much of that increase is due to the type of super-spreader event B.C. had long avoided, where a group of asymptomatic people with COVID-19 went to a number of parties around Kelowna on and around Canada Day.

So there hasn't been a dramatic rise of cases in the Lower Mainland. And when you parse the data, there hasn't been a surge among old people. Or middle-aged people. Or children.

No, the increase in cases is fuelled by positive cases among people between the ages of 20 and 29. After months where the average for that age group was between two and three cases a day, it's been steadily rising through June, and has been around 13 a day for the past week.

It's why Henry spent much of her time on Monday talking directly to ""young people,"" as she put it, asking them to refrain from risky behaviour — because while the surge is mostly confined to them so far, they can easily spread it to older people who can have worse health outcomes.

""Be my voice on social media,"" she said.

""Use your influence to share a message with your friends. Don't let COVID-19 spoil your summer. We can play safe and stay safe.""

Adjustments need to be made

The fact the increase is focused on a particular area and particular demographic can help the province fine tune their message for 20-somethings and consider additional restrictions on certain businesses — think restaurants and bars — in the weeks ahead.

""[Dr. Henry] needs to use some of the instruments, some of the tools at her disposal to get contact numbers back down, so that transmission numbers get back down,"" said Dr. David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health, who said this sort of timeline was predictable from the outset.

""We're going to get our numbers down, we're going to reopen as much as we can, we're going to know we've gone too far because cases start to surge, and then we're going to look to strong public health leaders to say 'OK, these are the things we need to dial back.'""

Dr. David Fisman speaks with Stephen Quinn about what people should and shouldn't be concerned about after three days of increase. 9:01

And B.C. is in an enviable position when it comes to making adjustments. The total number of people in critical care is in single digits, it's been more than a week since the last COVID-related death, and the number of care homes with active outbreaks — once as high as 26 — is down to one.

That B.C. needs to ""dial it back"" a bit, as Dr. Fisman put it, is clear.

So is the fact we're in a fortunate position to do so.

""I don't think people need to be unduly concerned,"" he said.

""[But] folks need to realize this isn't done, it's not gone. Going to bars with a large group of your friends is not a way to keep yourself safe or your family safe.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-cases-triple-young-people-1.5658323?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia

Toronto begins the season at Tampa Bay on Friday and is scheduled to play its first home game on July 29 against the defending champion Washington Nationals.

The letter of expectation is meant to make the RCMP more accountable to the First Nation and help build a new relationship between police and the community.

Kwanlin Dün First Nation and the Yukon and federal governments signed a community tripartite agreement on June 12 through which three RCMP officers will be contracted to provide dedicated services to Kwanlin Dün First Nation.

""It is the letter of expectation that will guide how these three RCMP officers will operate while they are stationed here,"" Kwanlin Dün First Nation Chief Doris Bill said during a press conference on Tuesday.

New policing philosophy

She said the letter outlines a new policing philosophy based on ""community relationships, accountability to us, the First Nation, and increased communication.""

The three officers are expected to work closely with Kwanlin Dün First Nation's community safety officers , and in accordance with the letter of expectation.

The letter requires RCMP to deliver monthly policing reports, and to meet with Kwanlin Dün First Nation council quarterly. At the same time, Kwanlin Dün First Nation will provide cultural awareness training to the RCMP to help them better understand the community they're policing.

The letter also requires officers take part in community events, ""interact and be visible with the public on a daily basis,"" and volunteer on Kwanlin Dün First Nation boards and committees, reads a Tuesday press release.

'We need to reform the police'

""This whole notion of defunding the police, I don't necessarily agree with that notion. We need to reform the police and the police need to create space for community-born initiatives like ours, because we know what we need,"" said Bill.

""We know the community safety officer program works because it was built by the community for the community.""

Yukon RCMP Chief Superintendent Scott Sheppard said the letter adds a new layer of police accountability.

""Our members are engaged in the community — youth, all the way to elders. They are familiar with the community members,"" he said. ""What really this letter serves to provide both sides is … an accountability mechanism.""

The letter, he said, ""brings some form and process to what is already a very good relationship.""

Community tripartite agreements are not new in Canada, but until recently, there had been only one in Yukon, with Liard First Nation, according to Tuesday's news release.

25144,2020-07-21 21:01,Calgary to make masks mandatory in indoor public spaces as of Aug. 1,"Citing the rising numbers of coronavirus cases, the city of Calgary says it will make masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces starting Aug. 1.

Council voted 12-3 in favour of the new bylaw on Tuesday, with Councillors Sean Chu, Jeromy Farkas and Joe Magliocca voting against.

""We need to take bold action now if we want schools to reopen, if we want kids to feel safe, if we don't want to close the economy again,"" Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said.

""This is critical.""

Experts have expressed concern about Alberta's rising COVID-19 cases, half of which are in Calgary. The province reported 509 new cases in the last four days, bringing the active case total to 1,193.

""I believe we're in wave two,"" Calgary Emergency Management Agency chief Tom Sampson said, adding the situation is worsening and that hopefully taking fast action will prevent another lockdown.

He said provincial health officials have supported the idea of a mask bylaw.

Similar rules have been put in place across Quebec municipalities, and in Toronto and Ottawa.

Public health shouldn't be a partisan political issue. - Coun. Jeff Davison.

The bylaw, which will require people to wear a face covering that covers their mouth, nose and chin, would apply to all indoor public spaces in the city, like malls and grocery stores, as well as on Calgary Transit, or in taxis or Ubers.

It does not include schools, daycares and multi-family residential buildings.

Those who fail to wear a mask could be fined $100, but city officials say the focus will be on education over ticketing.

It will not apply to children under age 2, people with underlying medical conditions that inhibit their ability to wear a mask, people who are eating or drinking, or people who are engaging in a fitness activity, among other exemptions.

""I think given the very, very worrying numbers that we're seeing in Calgary … Calgarians need to appreciate that without a significant move now, we might be spending Christmas or Thanksgiving alone in our houses,"" Coun. Evan Woolley said.

""We're not playing here, this is serious and people are suffering,"" said Coun. Druh Farrell.

Coun. Magliocca, who voted against the bylaw, said he could not support what he described as further government interference in people's lives.

Here is the sign that is proposed be posted in all indoor public spaces in Calgary. If bylaw is approved, it would be mandatory. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/yyccc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#yyccc</a> <a href=""https://t.co/OdvePGAkdA"">pic.twitter.com/OdvePGAkdA</a> —@CBCScott

On Monday, United Nurses of Alberta President Heather Smith wrote a letter to the mayors of Alberta's six largest cities, asking them to mandate the wearing of face coverings in public spaces.

""I know that our members are reminded daily of the gravity of this pandemic, the serious health consequences COVID-19 poses, and the rationale behind the effectiveness of mask wearing to suppress the spread of this dangerous new virus,"" she wrote.

Coun. Jeff Davison said keeping case numbers down will be also instrumental in resuming economic growth.

""Public health shouldn't be a partisan political issue,"" he tweeted.

The final details will be discussed and voted on by council next Monday, in advance of the bylaw taking effect.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-mandatory-masks-1.5658125?cmp=rss,news,canada,calgary
25138,2020-07-21 20:13,"Trump says of Ghislaine Maxwell, 'I wish her well'","U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday offered sympathetic words to Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime companion of Jeffrey Epstein who stands accused of facilitating the abuse of girls by the now-deceased sex offender.

""I just wish her well, frankly,"" Trump said when asked about Maxwell during his coronavirus news briefing.

Maxwell, 58, was denied bail last week and is to remain behind bars as she awaits trial on charges she recruited girls for the financier to sexually abuse more than two decades ago. The British socialite was a romantic partner of Epstein, who killed himself in prison several weeks after being charged with sex trafficking.

An indictment alleged that Maxwell groomed the victims to endure sexual abuse and was sometimes there when Epstein abused them. It also alleged she lied during a 2016 deposition in a civil case.

Epstein associated over the years with many high-profile figures in politics and business, including Trump, former U.S. president Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and the retail mogul Leslie Wexner.

""I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach,"" Trump said of Maxwell.

25209,2020-07-21 19:49,"Halifax council approves renaming Cornwallis Park, creating new museum","Halifax regional council approved Tuesday all but one recommendation of a task force that looked at how Halifax should commemorate the city's controversial founder, as well as Indigenous history.

Edward Cornwallis, the British governor of Nova Scotia between 1749 and 1752, founded Halifax in 1749. He issued a so-called scalping proclamation that same year against Mi'kmaw men, women and children, and offered a bounty to anyone who carried out the killings.

A statue of Cornwallis in a downtown park named after him was removed in 2018 and will remain in storage until a civic museum is created.

""Nobody should walk the streets of our city and avoid monuments they find offensive,"" said Mayor Mike Savage. ""This is less about history to me than it is about the future.""

The task force provided 20 recommendations, which included:

Renaming Cornwallis Park the Peace and Friendship Park.

HRM should work with the Mi'kmaw community to generate a longer list of new potential names for streets and other civic assets, and use the Mi'kmaw language more in naming and signage.

The city should work with Mi'kmaw organizations to offer educational opportunities outside formal school in areas like treaty education and Mi'kmaw language education.

A number of councillors and the mayor said the vote was an important step toward reconciliation.

Coun. Lisa Blackburn took a hard line against the emails and calls she received from some people upset over the belief the recommendations were removing British history and culture from Nova Scotia.

""Every day at noon when you hear the gun, your British culture is being recognized ... if you've enjoyed a stroll in the Public Gardens, your British culture is being recognized and every time you look up Duke Street and see Citadel Hill hovering in the horizon, your British culture is being recognized,"" she said.

""You are immersed in it with every breath you take.""

Objections

Coun. Matt Whitman voted against the recommendations, but did not take part in the debate. Two other councillors objected.

""To have it put in a museum, we should suggest putting it in the stadium because the chances of having either of them are slim and none,"" said Coun. Steve Adams. ""I think this is a missed opportunity.""

""I don't believe the statue should never be put in a position of public commemoration again,"" said Coun. David Hendsbee. ""I believe it has a place somewhere in our municipality.""

To commemorate Indigenous history, Coun. Sam Austin offered up newly created streets in Dartmouth Cove or green space next to the Sawmill River project.

""Both these areas stand out as excellent opportunities for commemoration because that waterway from our harbour all the way to Maitland was their highway for over 10,000 years,"" he said.

What change was made

Council only made one change and it dealt with the recommendation on renaming Cornwallis Street and calling it New Horizons Street. The councillor for the area, Lindell Smith, wanted the local community to be consulted first and his amendment received unanimous approval.

Chief administrative officer Jacques Dubé said city staff would be coming to council in early 2021 with a report on the first phase of the civic museum project. There is $2.5 million from the sale of the former Dartmouth City Hall being held in a reserve account for a civic museum.

The CAO also has to do a yearly progress report for councillors on the task force's recommendations.

25136,2020-07-21 19:37,Few Windsor-Essex farms conducting on-site COVID-19 testing through Ontario Health,"Despite vocal encouragement from political leaders and health officials both locally and provincially, CBC News has learned a small fraction of agriculture operations in Essex County have participated in on-site COVID-19 testing during the pandemic through Ontario Health.

As of July 6, 19 farms have completed on-site testing, according to Ontario Health — that number remains the same two weeks later. despite the fact that five more farms were scheduled to complete on-site testing.

Ontario Health said it was unable to accommodate an interview, but sent the following statement to CBC News:

""We know that on-site testing is only part of this very complex picture, and for this reason, we have altered our approach in order to better accommodate other factors unique to this high-risk population. Testing is focused on the best approach in light of the situation, while working in partnership with the local public health unit and others to support testing of agricultural workers in the region.""

With more than 8,000 migrant farm workers in the region, about ""2,800 tests have been conducted to date in Windsor-Essex, and approximately 1,800 of these have been on-site at 19 farms across the area,"" Ontario Health told CBC News.

In addition to on-site testing, workers can also get tested at assessment centres and through public health contact tracing.

A brief overview of COVID-19 cases, testing and deaths in the region since June 9. 1:32

Leamington, Ont. resident Joan Grey, who is also the founder of a migrant worker not-for-profit called Unity Hopeful and who's been helping migrant workers in Essex County for more than nine years, said she can't seem to understand why so few farms are providing on-site COVID-19 testing.

""That is mind blowing. That is ridiculous. ... I don't know what's going on there,"" she said. ""I know personally that the farm workers want to be tested because I speak to them on a daily basis.""

Testing is voluntary, but Grey said mandatory testing should be the path forward.

About a month ago, Premier Doug Ford appeared frustrated with the lack of testing among farm workers.

""I'll go to the extreme,"" he said. ""I'll start pulling out every tool at my disposal to make sure this gets done.""

There were no firm promises on how that is being done on Tuesday's daily update.

""It's all hands on deck. It's the same situation. There's a group of migrant workers who have spiked things up a little bit, but we're working with the farmers. We're going to continue testing on as many farms as possible.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said ""it's all hands on deck"" and that the province is ""going to continue testing on as many farms as possible."" (CBC)

The Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers told CBC News 43 of its 118 members participated in either on-site testing or conducted testing at the assessment centre, but it's unclear when that took place or why the others haven't done it.

For Grey, she's unsure who is to blame for how the situation with migrant workers has gotten to this point.

""Somebody is not doing their job. I don't know who it is, but somebody is not doing their job,"" she said.

""These workers should have been taken care of. They're not being taken care of in the way they should.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/few-essex-county-farms-on-site-testing-1.5658054?cmp=rss,news,canada,windsor

25129,2020-07-21 18:57,"Pandemic will get 'worse before it gets better,' Trump warns","The coronavirus pandemic in the United States will probably ""get worse before it gets better,"" U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday.

He also said health experts ""know who the vulnerable are,"" adding the median age of those who succumb to the respiratory illness is 78 with roughly half of all deaths from COVID-19 being individuals in long-term care homes. He promised they will be protected, while the U.S. continues to build a ""very powerful strategy"" to fight the virus.

Trump said there has been progress with developing therapeutic treatments and that two potential vaccines for COVID-19 are entering the final stage of clinical trials, while ""nobody thought that would be possible.""

He said the country has learned much about the disease, and ""my administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important.""

Trump recommended Americans use basic preventative measures, such as maintaining a physical distance from others, and when that's not possible, wearing a mask.

He said he carries a mask with him and uses it in certain circumstances, such as being in an elevator with security staff.

""I have no problem with the masks. Anything that can potentially help is a good thing,"" said Trump, who had previously declined to wear a face covering and has sent mixed signals about them.

Trump had pulled the plug on his freewheeling daily coronavirus briefings when they turned into a political liability this spring, but he resumed the task on Tuesday, looking to halt a campaign-season erosion of support as new cases spike across the country.

The White House briefing rolled out as the next stage of Washington's response to the pandemic was being crafted on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers and White House officials were opening negotiations on a trillion-dollar-or-more ""phase four"" rescue package.

Although Trump announced on Monday that he would resume his regular coronavirus briefings, he did not share the stage on Tuesday with members of his coronavirus task force, including top public health experts, doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx.

When a reporter asked ""where is Dr. Fauci?"" Trump responded by saying ""Well, Dr. Birx is right outside.""

During a visit to South Carolina on Tuesday, head of the coronavirus task force Vice-President Mike Pence said members have been travelling the country to discuss the pandemic, adding he would visit Florida ""in a few short days.

""We think it's important that our team is on the ground, that we're working closely with governors and with health officials,"" Pence said. ""But we'll continue to brief the country going forward.""

25134,2020-07-21 18:43,Cleveland MLB players meet with owner to discuss potential name change,"Cleveland's players met Tuesday with owner Paul Dolan to discuss a potential name change for the team, which has been called the Indians for the past 105 years.

Manager Terry Francona said the group had an ""honest"" conversation and he came away proud of how it was handled by all involved.

""The way the players expressed themselves in a mature manner and in a respectful manner, and the way Paul listened and spoke back to the players,"" said Francona, who attended the meeting along with team president Chris Antonetti and general manager Mike Chernoff. ""I was really, really happy and content to just sit there and let them talk back and forth.""

Francona stressed that nothing has been resolved over the controversial topic.

The franchise recently announced it was in the early stages of meeting with the community and appropriate stakeholders ""to determine the best path forward with regard to our team name.""

The Indians' move coincided with the recent decision by Washington's NFL team to drop the name Redskins, which had been decried as being racist for decades.

Cleveland removed its contentious Chief Wahoo logo from its game jerseys and caps. Fans, however, can still buy merchandise bearing the red-faced, toothy mascot that became a symbol of hatred to some and civic pride to others.

Francona said the meeting with Dolan was a positive, significant step.

""I don't know that anything was actually resolved and I don't know if it needed to be,"" Francona said. ""I just thought it was really good for the players to share their opinions, and let Paul be in the room and hear them and also to share his opinions as an owner.

""I think sometimes perspectives can be different and it's good for everybody to hear that. But I think everybody was so genuinely honest and also respectful in the way they gave their opinions,"" he said.

'Time to move forward,' says manager

Francona, who has been Cleveland's manager since 2013, was outspoken on the possible name change several weeks ago, saying it was ""time to move forward."" He said he didn't want his stance to have any influence on his players.

""I don't feel like it's my business to sway our players to feel one way or another about that,"" he said. ""I just don't feel right about that.""

The possible name change wasn't the only topic discussed and the team touched on ""a little bit of everything"" with Dolan, Francona said.

During the playing of the national anthem before exhibition games, Cleveland's players have been standing next to each other in front of their dugout with one had over their hearts and the other on a teammate's shoulder. They decided to stand and not kneel during the anthem to show unity and as a way of express their support for social justice and reforms.

Francona credited Dolan for his willingness to engage with the players.

""These things don't happen everywhere,"" he said. ""It's not going to mean that everybody is going to exactly agree or be on the same page. I don't know that you're supposed to be all the time. That's the way our world is. But when everybody listens with respect and talks with respect, I think we have a chance of moving forward with respect.

25133,2020-07-21 18:37,'Comfortable with being uncomfortable': Tavares says Leafs adjusting to changes,"Toronto Maple Leafs captain John Tavares says players are getting ""comfortable with being uncomfortable"" as Phase 4 of the NHL's return-to-play plan approaches.

From being isolated in a hotel, to unfamiliar opening faceoff times, to coming out of the visitors' locker-room at Scotiabank Arena, the new normal will take some getting used to.

For most players, at least. Defenceman Justin Holl said some aspects of Toronto's upcoming playoff qualifying series with the Columbus Blue Jackets will remind him of his days with the American Hockey League's Toronto Marlies.

Scotiabank Arena will serve as one of the two hub arenas, along with Edmonton's Rogers Place, when the NHL starts up again Aug. 1. So while all the games of Toronto's best-of-five series with Columbus will be on home turf, the Maple Leafs will be visitors in their own building for Game 3 and, if necessary, Game 4.

""That's going to be weird, but I was telling the guys on the team it's kind of like the American League days when we'd have the Boxing Day games at [Scotiabank Arena],"" Holl said. We'd be getting dressed in the guest locker rooms, or sometimes the Raptors room, so it's just going to be a little throwback.""

Holl played three seasons with the Marlies and helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018. His AHL experience also gives him a good handle on best-of-five playoff series — ""It's do-or-die a little quicker than normal,"" he said — and early start times. Game 2 of the Leafs vs. Blue Jackets series is scheduled for a Tuesday afternoon.

""I love it,"" Holl said. ""A noon game is just like a school game we used to play. Wake up and play and it's awesome.

""Same with a 4 o'clock game. Those will be a bit of an adjustment, but everyone's on the same kind of level playing field and we're all going to have to adjust to it.""

Given the need for teams to isolate at their hubs due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some of the NHL qualifying round and playoffs is going to feel foreign to all players. It's not clear to them exactly how life will look inside the ""bubbles"" being set up.

""I truly have no idea what we're going to be in for,"" Holl said.

Players anticipate they will find ways to pass the time. Some have mentioned brining their video game consoles with them. Star forward Auston Matthews has apparently learned some new card tricks. Tavares believes there will be ""some really good food options.""

""We're very fortunate being here in Toronto, the diversity and the type of cultures and the type of food and the people who want to be a part of this,"" he said.

Tavares said whatever life looks like inside the bubble, players are simply lucky to be able to play hockey in the midst of COVID-19.

""Everyone's starting to have a better feel for what life is like during a pandemic and I think just feeling fortunate to be able to compete. We could play anywhere and just having a chance to play for the Stanley Cup is what it's all about,"" he said.

""So I think for our group, the getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and dealing with the uncertainties — we're the visiting team in our own building, there's going to be no fans — just it is what it is. The game's played between the boards. Go out there and find something you've done your whole life and just focus on competing, doing your job and doing it at a high level.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/toronto-maple-leafs-nhl-restart-1.5658064?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
25130,2020-07-21 18:33,Founder of mental health non-profit UnderstandUs resigns amid sexual harassment allegations,"The founder of the mental health organization UnderstandUs has resigned from his executive director position after numerous sexual allegations against him came to light.

Jim Demeray ""has agreed to resign from his position effective immediately and will no longer be involved with the organization,"" the board of directors of the Saskatchewan advocacy group said in an statement on Tuesday afternoon.

The board said it was recently made aware of ""serious allegations of misconduct"" through a CBC News investigation published on Sunday and updated Monday to reflect new allegations.

Fifteen former employees who brought allegations forward said they are struggling to reconcile Demeray's growing influence among schoolchildren with his past behaviour toward girls and young women in the restaurant industry between 2000 and 2016.

As part of his outreach with UnderstandUs, Demeray has spoken to thousands of students in elementary and high schools about vulnerability, emotions, stigma, healthy relationships, self-esteem, compassion and kindness.​​​​​​ UnderstandUs says it makes its biggest impact by ""engaging those in their most impressionable age.""

In 2019, UnderstandUs launched five awareness campaigns and gave presentations to 11,500 people in 12 cities, towns and First Nations in Saskatchewan.

When contacted by CBC, Demeray called allegations against him ""baseless and untrue,"" saying ""in my 16 years working in the restaurant business there was never a complaint or a suggestion that I acted inappropriately around female staff.""

Thirteen women have alleged a pattern of verbal sexual harassment and two say Demeray acted inappropriately toward them while in a position of power. Two men who worked in the kitchen at this time also came forward to corroborate the allegations.

The UnderstandUs board said ""the allegations that have been brought forward in no way reflect our values as an organization.""

It added that board members are committed to continuing the non-profit's mission of combating mental health stigma. The Regina-based volunteer board is made up of Colter Wood, Carleen Desautels, Kelsey Stewart and Nicole Cook. Mark Johnston was listed as a board member until midday Tuesday. Former board members and provincial government employees Tanessa Boutin and Aaron Orban left in mid-July, citing time commitments and work-life balance.

The board said it wants to build trust in the community and will ""immediately be starting a review"" of the organization's operations.

""It is our hope to take this opportunity to ensure we're operating to the highest standards, so we can continue the important work we know is needed, in opening up conversations and promoting a better understanding of mental health,"" the statement said.

Demeray founded UnderstandUs in 2011 when he was still working at the popular Canadian restaurant chain Earls. The chain fired him in 2016 and he has since focused almost entirely on promoting mental wellness and selling UnderstandUs clothing.

The organization gained momentum in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, UnderstandUs received donations totalling nearly $250,000 from the Tim Hortons Smile Cookie campaign. Proceeds were once again slated today go to UnderstandUs in 2020, but Tim Hortons said Monday it would no longer be donating to the organization.

The province also said that Demeray had resigned effective immediately from his board position with the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jim-demeray-resigns-understandus-1.5658029?cmp=rss,news,canada,saskatchewan
25131,2020-07-21 17:58,Wolastoqi scholar says Indigenous language bill will just sap scarce resources,"A new bill on Indigenous language education is sparking concern for St. Thomas University professor emeritus Andrea Bear-Nicholas.

Bear-Nicholas, who was the chair of the Native Studies department at St. Thomas University for 20 years, says the new bill undermines the critical need for Wolastoqey immersion classes for Indigenous students.

""I'm concerned, because it will require more speakers to be in more schools and to be teaching more students,"" Bear-Nicholas said.

""The plan to require [Indigenous] language in all public schools may actually draw away the resources we need, financial and human, into doing the immersion kind of project that is desperately needed before our language is going to be gone.""

Bear-Nicholas said there are barely enough teachers who can capably teach the language to the members of the Wolastoqey nation itself, and fears this may spread those teachers even thinner if they are to teach in other provincial schools.

The Indigenous languages bill was put forth by Green Party MLA Megan Mitton last month. A week ago, the bill was given unanimous support by an all-party committee of MLAs.

""It's important that there be some basic exposure to these languages"" Green Party MLA Megan Mitton said last week.

""If [the members of the legislative assembly's] purpose is concern for the language or respect for Indigenous peoples, we far more need to have language opportunities for our own children to be increased,"" Bear-Nicholas said.

Megan Mitton, the Green Party MLA in Memramcook-Tantramar, put forth the bill which would see Indigenous languages be added to the curriculum. (Tori Weldon/CBC News)

Green Party leader David Coon said the intent of the bill is to foster an appreciation of Indigenous languages in students.

""The intent is not to put Indigenous teachers into the schools to teach all peoples Indigenous languages in New Brunswick,"" Coon said. ""It's simply to foster an awareness among all students in our school system that Indigenous languages actually exist, are spoken, here's what the language sounds like and maybe just pass on the notion of how to say 'thank you,' to say 'hello,' and say 'welcome.'""

Bear-Nicholas said early childhood immersion is the only way to save the language, which has fewer than 100 fluent speakers remaining.

Prefers focus on Indigenous students

""We probably only have, if at all, five years left of being able to mount a reasonable immersion program in the preschools because all of our speakers are over 65 or 70,"" Bear-Nicholas said. ""It just doesn't make any sense at this point to be sort of saying 'OK, here's a gift for every student in the province to have a right to our language' when our own children don't even have enough support to maintain the language.""

""15,20,30,40 years ago this might have been fine, we would have had plenty of speakers,"" Bear-Nicholas said. ""But even then, it was really critical that we start immersion programs while our kids were still in communities where there were still some speakers.""

""Right now, our speakers are so few, we really are on the verge of extinction.""

Bear-Nicholas said early childhood immersion programs are being used all over the world in places such as Hawaii and New Zealand to revitalize languages that are on the decline.

David Coon, Green Party leader and MLA for Fredericton South said the implementation of an Indigenous Immersion program is a dream of his. (Logan Perley/CBC)

Coon said the implementation of Indigenous immersion programs is something he would like to see through, but at the moment is unable to put forward such a bill.

""We would have brought in a bill to drive immersion programs for Indigenous students in Indigenous languages if we had the ability to bring in bills that had financial implications,"" Coon said. ""But as an opposition party, you're actually not permitted to bring a bill forward that has implications to the budget.""

""That would have been my dream,"" Coon said.

Bear-Nicholas said crucial funding has been difficult to secure for an early childhood immersion program to be able to respectfully pay teachers and elders who hold the language.

Province not keeping promise

""This province has agreed to support a program in early childhood immersion five years ago,"" Bear-Nicholas said. ""They funded our little project then for a year and since then we've been begging for more funding to make this possible.""

Bear-Nicholas says if the province wants to give more exposure to First Nations cultures or languages, they should begin with treaty education, teaching the history on how the Peace and Friendship Treaties came to be signed.

""We need to be focusing more on our traditions and our history,"" Bear-Nicholas said. ""In fact, if we were to be teaching Indigenous history in this province, it would be everybody's history anyway.""

Coon said it was a bill he put forward a few years ago that made it mandatory that Indigenous history be taught in the provincial school systems. Coon said it was a discussion with Dave Perley of the Mi'kmaq-Wolastoqey Centre at UNB is what sparked the bill to add languages to that.

Coon said the concern should be on how the Indigenous languages bill is implemented, and not on the bill itself.

Bear-Nicholas said she thinks the bill should be withdrawn or suspended for further discussion.

""I think there should be a consultation in our communities, an open consultation, not a private one, that basically evaluates the effectiveness of that initial bill in the Education Act 7b.""

The bill will be voted on by members of the New Brunswick Legislature this fall.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wolastoqi-scholar-expresses-concern-over-new-language-bill-1.5656558?cmp=rss,news,canada,new-brunswick

It's part of a total of $8.4 million committed to more than a dozen organizations in Manitoba serving urban and off-reserve Indigenous people in Manitoba.

The funding comes through the federal government's Indigenous Community Support Program, which provides support for Indigenous organizations and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The program is distributing $90 million across Canada to Indigenous organizations providing services to First Nations people living off-reserve, and Indigenous Peoples in urban areas, the federal government said.

The Southern Chiefs' Organization, which represents 34 Anishinaabe and Dakota First Nations across southern Manitoba, received $775,165 through the fund.

Chiefs have received numerous requests for help from members living off-reserve since the beginning of the pandemic, Grand Chief Jerry Daniels said in a news release, largely for food and rent-security support.

""This funding will allow us to respond to this critical need,"" said Daniels.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-indigenous-organizations-receive-federal-1.5657930?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba

25128,2020-07-21 17:17,The Hart Trophy has had some strange moments,"This is an excerpt from The Buzzer, which is CBC Sports' daily email newsletter. Stay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here.

Here's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:

The NHL's MVP award has had a few moments over the years

The finalists for this year's Hart Trophy were announced today. Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl, Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon and the New York Rangers' Artemi Panarin were the three top vote-getters for the NHL's MVP award, which is chosen by members of the hockey writers' association. The winner will be announced during the conference finals of the upcoming playoffs.

Draisaitl is favoured to win the Hart for the first time after piling up 110 points in 71 games to run away with the scoring title by 13 points over Connor McDavid. Draisaitl's teammate wasn't a finalist for the Hart despite being the consensus best player in hockey. The last time two teammates finished in the top three in voting was 2001, when Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr did it.

The Hart was first awarded after the 1923-24 season — only a few years after the NHL itself was born. So it has a long and interesting history. Here are a few more fun Hart-facts, and some interesting stuff related to them.

Wayne Gretzky owns the all-time record for most Hart Trophies with nine. Gordie Howe is second with six, followed by (somewhat surprisingly) Eddie Shore with four. A bunch of guys have three.

Gretzky won an incredible eight in a row from 1980-87. Those all came with Edmonton, and he added his ninth (and final) Hart in '89, for his first season with Los Angeles. Two things prevented the Great One from winning 10 in a row: a knee injury that cost him 16 games in his final season with the Oilers, and Mario Lemieux. Despite the missed time, Gretzky still finished second in the 1987-88 scoring race with 149 points. He also led the league in points per game with 2.33.

But Lemieux's raw numbers were too big for voters to ignore: 70 goals and 168 points in a relatively healthy (very healthy by Lemieux's standards) 77 games. So he won the first of his three Harts. But Lemieux acknowledged who the best player in the game was when he said: ""The only reason Gretzky did not win the Hart is because he was hurt."" Also, maybe the voters got bored with Gretzky, because he actually finished third in the voting. Edmonton goalie Grant Fuhr was second.

The next year, Lemieux had 85 goals and 199 points — and didn't win the Hart. Those are absurd numbers. Only Gretzky and Brett Hull have ever scored more goals in a season, and only Gretzky has notched more points. And yet, Gretzky won the vote that year with a relatively modest (for him, anyway) 54 goals and 168 points. That was the Great One's first season in L.A. after his seismic trade from Edmonton, and he helped the Kings improve from a 68-point team the year before to 91 points — fourth overall in the NHL. Pittsburgh finished with 87 points. So the narrative winds were at Gretzky's back.

Phil Esposito broke the single-season goals and points records — and didn't win the Hart. In 1970-71, Esposito set new records with 76 goals and 152 points. But he finished second in the Hart vote to Boston teammate Bobby Orr, who had 37 and 139. This may have been the correct choice because Orr's numbers were not of this world for a defenceman. But still, tough beat for Espo. He hid finish his career with two Harts, though.

No one has ever won the Hart unanimously, but Lemieux came as close as possible. He fell one vote shy in 1993. That's the year he won the scoring title by 12 points despite missing two months in the middle of the season while he underwent treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's one of the greatest (and most heartwarming) achievements in sports history, making Lemieux one of the easiest Hart picks ever. And yet some guy voted for Pat Lafontaine, the runner-up in the scoring race. The Buffalo star finished third for the Hart, behind Toronto's Doug Gilmour.

Alex Ovechkin is the active leader in Hart Trophies with three. He won those in 2008, '09 and '13. Sidney Crosby is the only other active player with multiple Harts. He's won two, in 2007 and '14. Crosby is also tied with Jaromir Jagr and Jean Beliveau for the most runner-up finishes with four.

Only three Hart winners who are eligible for the Hockey Hall of Fame haven't gotten in. They are Tom Anderson (1942), Al Rollins (1954) and José Théodore (2002). Rollins' victory has to be the strangest. He posted an ugly 12-47-7 record and 3.21 goals-against average. Those are not MVP-calibre stats by any stretch. But Rollins edged star Detroit defenceman Red Kelly in an extremely close race (and also beat Rocket Richard and Gordie Howe) because enough voters figured Rollins was the only thing keeping his awful Chicago Black Hawks team from complete oblivion. He played all but four games and Chicago lost them all. One of his backups had a 9.00 GAA. The other's was 5.50. Rollins' teammates gave him almost no help: they scored less than two goals per game and gave up nearly 3.5 — easily the worst in the league in both departments. So Rollins played bravely. Even admirably. But it mostly seems like the voters just felt bad for him.

Edmonton's CFL team is changing its name

The club abruptly announced this afternoon that it ""has made the decision to discontinue the use of the word 'Eskimo' in the team's name."" It had been in use for more than 100 years, but the franchise said in a press release that ""views regarding the team name are shifting. While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker.""

Pressure to drop the name increased recently after the Washington NFL team indicated it would retire its name, which many consider an Indigenous slur. Initially, Edmonton appeared insistent on keeping its name, pointing to studies it had conducted that showed ""no consensus"" among Inuit communities for whether it should be changed. But some sponsors later threatened to cut ties with the team if it didn't commit to a name change.

Until a new name is picked, Edmonton will call itself the EE Football Team and/or the Edmonton Football Team. Read more about the dropping of the old name here.

Quickly...

The Banjo Bowl has moved off the field. The CFL's best rivalry — between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the Saskatchewan Roughriders — normally peaks with an annual pair of back-to-back regular-season contests: the Labour Day (weekend) Classic in Regina and the Banjo Bowl rematch in Winnipeg. With the season still on hold due to the pandemic, fans of those teams might not be breaking out the hollowed-out watermelons or the honey dill sauce at all this year. But the rivalry is carrying on away from the gridiron.

Both the Saskatchewan and Manitoba governments are aggressively bidding to host the CFL's games if it decides to play a shortened season. The league still hasn't officially chosen to do that, but it's currently negotiating with the players' union on a deal that would make it possible. The CFL has imposed a deadline of this Thursday to reach an agreement. Read more about that here, and more about the outside obstacles facing the potential host cities here.

The NHL and the NBA both reported encouraging results from their latest round of testing. The NHL said yesterday that COVID-19 testing from the first five days of formal training camps (July 13-17) returned only two positive results. That's out of 2,618 tests involving more than 800 players. The NBA reported zero positive results from the 346 players tested over the last seven days at its ""campus"" inside Disney World. Looks like both leagues are in good shape to restart as scheduled next week.

Alyssa Nakken made baseball history. She became the first woman to coach in an on-field capacity during a major-league game when she took over as the San Francisco Giants' first-base coach during an exhibition contest last night. Nakken was hired by new Giants manager Gabe Kapler back in the winter, when she became the first woman to land a full-time coaching job in the majors. She played softball in college before joining the Giants as an intern in 2014.

Toronto FC advanced to the next round of the MLS is Back Tournament — but it's unlikely another Canadian team will join them. Today's 0-0 draw between Toronto and New England gave both teams a 1-0-2 record and ensured they'll both advance to the 16-team knockout stage. TFC can finish no worse than second in the group, and still possibly first. The top two teams in each group move on, plus the four best third-place teams. The other two Canadian teams — Montreal and Vancouver — are both 0-2-0 and in last place in their respective groups. Montreal plays its final match tonight. Vancouver's is Thursday. Both teams need to win and get help. FiveThirtyEight's projection system gives Montreal a 30 per cent chance of advancing and Vancouver only 4 per cent.

25126,2020-07-21 17:11,RCMP watchdog calls out 'unreasonable' use of force during wellness checks,"The independent watchdog for the RCMP says it frequently has concerns about Mounties' ""unreasonable use of force"" during mental health wellness calls.

In response to some recent high-profile and controversial incidents involving the RCMP, the chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC) put out a statement today highlighting some of her agency's concerns about Mounties' actions.

""With respect to interacting with people in crisis, the commission's findings have consistently highlighted concerns about police adopting a 'command and control' approach — an authoritative style of dealing with a non‑compliant person,"" said Michelaine Lahaie.

""The commission's reports have repeatedly found that this 'command and control' approach has led to the RCMP's unreasonable use of force in apprehending persons in crisis.""

The CRCC is the independent body created to review Mounties' behaviour. It receives, on average, more than 2,000 complaints from the public every year, ranging from allegations of wrongful arrest and improper use of force to reports of bad driving.

Over the past five years, the commission has issued 14 findings which concluded the RCMP's actions involving a wellness check or a person in crisis were ""unreasonable,"" said Lahaie.

The reports have not been made public for privacy reasons, says the statement, but the chair said it's in the public interest to convey the commission's ""general pattern of concern.""

The RCMP is under pressure to explain why an officer shot and killed Rodney Levi, a member of the Metepenagiag First Nation in New Brunswick, last month. His family said he suffered from mental health problems.

Levi was the second Indigenous person in New Brunswick to be shot by a police officer in just eight days. Chantel Moore, 26, was shot by an officer with the Edmundston Police Department during a wellness check.

On the other side of the country, an RCMP member is the subject of a criminal and code-of-conduct investigation and a lawsuit after a video emerged last month showing the officer dragging UBC-Okanagan nursing student Mona Wang down a hallway and stepping on her head during a wellness check in January.

CRCC recommends limiting police presence

These types of incidents have spurred advocates, and Canada's largest psychiatric facility, to demand officers be removed from the front line response to people in mental health emergencies.

In a report from earlier this year, Lahaie said she recommended that RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki direct her commanding officers to work with the provinces and territories to develop different health care‑led options.

That report also asked the commissioner to consider amending RCMP policies to limit police involvement during wellness calls to instances where a police presence is necessary, based on criminality or a risk to public safety.

""I await the commissioner's response to my report,"" said Lahaie.

""I am hopeful that the increased public attention on this developing area of policing will allow the RCMP to find the right balance and establish effective policies, training and procedures to respond to people in crisis and to handle requests for wellness checks.""

The CRCC chair isn't the first person to call out the RCMP's use of force when dealing with mental health calls.

Lahaie notes that the inquiry into the death of Robert Dziekanski, who died after being stunned multiple times with a Taser in the arrivals lounge of Vancouver International Airport in 2007, found that the ""command and control philosophy underlying police recruit training, however appropriate generally, is both inappropriate and counterproductive when dealing with emotionally disturbed people.""

Retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci echoed those findings during his 2014 review of how Toronto police approach people in crisis. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair was the chief of the Toronto Police Service at the time.

""The challenge, and one of the most critical requirements for police, is to know how to de-escalate a crisis involving a person who, as a result of what is effectively a transient or permanent mental disability, may not respond appropriately (or at all) to standard police commands,"" he wrote.

""The use of force by police should always be a last resort.""

25125,2020-07-21 17:02,"Gov. Gen. Payette has created a toxic climate of harassment and verbal abuse at Rideau Hall, sources allege","Gov. Gen. Julie Payette has created a toxic environment at Rideau Hall by verbally harassing employees to the point where some have been reduced to tears or have left the office altogether, sources tell CBC News.

Four members of Payette's communications team have departed during the pandemic period alone. A fifth person is leaving this week and another two have taken leaves of absence. It's just the latest wave of staff to quietly transfer out of the small office in response to mistreatment during Payette's mandate, multiple sources said.

""This has gone from being one of the most collegial and enjoyable work environments for many of the staff to being a house of horrors,"" said one government source. ""It's bullying and harassment at its worst.""

CBC News spoke to a dozen sources with direct knowledge of the office during Payette's mandate. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared they could lose their jobs or their careers could suffer. Many of the sources are still in the public service, while others are former Rideau Hall employees.

The sources say Payette has yelled at, belittled and publicly humiliated employees. They accuse her of throwing tantrums in the office and, on one occasion, tossing an employee's work aside and calling it ""shit.""

On a single day, multiple people were seen leaving Payette's office with tears in their eyes after private meetings with the Governor General, said one source. In another instance, a staff member was spotted crying in their car.

""She screams and humiliates staff in front of others,"" said a former employee. ""It's verbal abuse. In no world is it OK to treat people that way.""

Payette's secretary and longtime friend, Assunta Di Lorenzo, is also accused of harassing employees and calling some ""lazy"" and ""incompetent.""

""[Di Lorenzo is] also a bully,"" said a source. ""When confronted with something she's unsure of, instead of giving you the benefit of the doubt, she comes at you as a pit bull.""

Reporting in 'stark contrast' to reality, says Rideau Hall

In a statement issued to CBC News, Rideau Hall said Payette and the management of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General ""strongly"" believe ""in the importance of a healthy workplace, we have taken many steps to foster this, we will continue to do so and will work at constantly improving.""

""We deeply regret this reporting, which is in stark contrast to the reality of working at the OSGG, and obscures the important work done by our dedicated staff in honouring, representing, and showcasing Canadians,"" said Ashlee Smith, press secretary to the Governor General.

The Prime Minister's Office said all Canadians have to work in a ""healthy, respectful and safe environment,"" but referred CBC's questions to Rideau Hall.

""Our government is committed to ensuring that all federally-regulated workplaces are free from harassment of any kind,"" said PMO press secretary Ann-Clara Vaillancourt.

Payette's trailblazing career

Payette was appointed Governor General on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October 2017. She is just over half way through her mandate, which will end in October 2022 if it's not extended.

Payette is a Montreal-born trailblazer — a former astronaut who's been to space twice and is also a computer engineer, pilot, academic, musician and executive.

Although Payette's role as the Queen's representative in Canada is mostly ceremonial, the vice-regal position can be an important one in a minority government situation. Payette is bound by constitutional convention to follow the advice of the prime minister if the PM requests a dissolution or prorogation of Parliament, but she is empowered to dismiss a government that has been defeated on a vote of confidence if it refuses to step aside.

The National Post has written extensively about Payette's struggle to adapt to her new public role. The newspaper reported that Payette is a deeply private person who is involved in the minutia of administration, has pushed back against protocol and has cut down her workload.

Rideau Hall among the worst in public service for harassment

As reported by Maclean's magazine, the 2019 federal Public Service Employee Survey said that 22 per cent of respondents working for Rideau Hall claimed to have experienced harassment, down from 25 per cent in 2018 — still the third-highest harassment level reported by any federal department or agency.

The annual survey offers the only publicly available data on the extent of harassment in the bureaucracy.

In 2019, just over one-in-five of the 126 Rideau Hall employees who responded to the survey reported having been victims of harassment on the job over a 12-month period.

Of those Rideau Hall employees who reported harassment, 74 per cent attributed it to individuals with authority over them.

Half of the 28 self-reported victims said they were humiliated, 47 per cent reported dealing with someone exerting excessive control, 40 per cent felt excluded or ignored, and 44 per cent said they dealt with aggressive behaviour.

""These are not one-time issues,"" said a government source. ""This is a constant assault upon those who work in and around and for the Governor General, Madame Payette.

""It's beyond anything that a public servant or anyone working for an institution should have to endure.""

Humiliating huddles on planes

The people who report directly to Payette — managers, the communications team, those involved in programming and those who travel with Payette — bear the brunt of the harassment, said many sources. Pantry workers and NCC maintenance staff also have been left visibly upset or shaken after being questioned directly by Payette.

In one four-month period, roughly two dozen people reported abusive conduct by Payette or Di Lorenzo to management, according to government sources.

The harassment often happens on a one-to-one basis; any specific examples reported by CBC News could be traced back to sources. But sources have described broader patterns in Payette's alleged behaviour toward staff.

Part of Payette's job is to attend state visits around the world to meet with dignitaries and build on Canada's international ties. Sources claim that travel brings out the worst in Payette. Multiple sources described the Governor General routinely complaining of being tired, underfed and overworked.

Sources say Payette often uses flights home from trips abroad to criticize staff in front of their peers over what she sees as their shortcomings. Payette frequently asks staff members to huddle around her on the plane for a debriefing, then verbally attacks employees over what she considers to be poor work, said sources.

Several sources said such in-flight debriefs can last hours. Employees have been seen crying in their vehicles on the way home, said sources.

""When you see people in tears, something is not right,"" a former employee told CBC.

Sources say Payette is known for dropping what they call ""explosions,"" ""tantrums"" or ""bursts of emotion"" on staff at Rideau Hall. Such outbursts are often centred around Payette being upset with the quality of someone's work and the belief that she has to do everything herself because everyone else is incompetent.

""She needs to control absolutely everything,"" said one government source. ""If things don't go the way she wants it to go, she needs to find someone responsible for it.""

'A victim at every meeting'

During meetings with staff, sources said, Payette has been known to ""grill"" employees on files unrelated to the meeting topic.

""There was always that level of criticism and I would say in almost every meeting somebody was berated,"" said one former employee. ""There was, I'll go as far to say, a victim at every meeting.""

At the beginning of her mandate, sources said, Payette also put staff on the spot by quizzing them about outer space — asking them to name all the planets in the solar system, for example, or to state the distance between the sun and the moon.

""She loves these gotcha moments,"" said one government source. ""She's just smarter than you and she likes to let you know that.""

Most sources said Payette often makes decisions with the help of a very small inner circle that includes Di Lorenzo.

A former lawyer and executive in Montreal, Di Lorenzo is supposed to keep Payette's office running smoothly and effectively. Multiple sources said Di Lorenzo is struggling more than two years into the job — which is typically filled by a seasoned public servant — and still doesn't understand how the public service works.

Watch: Former Rideau Hall employee says colleagues were reduced to tears by criticism

The government had to create an entirely new position to assist Di Lorenzo — an associate secretary who is a veteran public servant.

Sources said Di Lorenzo has been seen yelling at Rideau Hall workers and claiming that she has to do everything for everyone.

""The way [Di Lorenzo] spoke to people was really harsh,"" said a former employee. ""It was like a punch every time she spoke to someone. She wasn't a team player. She gets over-involved and tries to do everyone's jobs for them but doesn't know what she's doing.""

""They will bully you until you either agree or leave,"" said a government source. ""It's bullying and harassment at its worst.""

High staff turnover

Di Lorenzo has had at least four executive assistants, according to sources in the public service. Payette has rotated through three executive assistants during her time at Rideau Hall — including one who served three past governors-general.

Five executives also left Payette's office in 2018 within a three-month period over their treatment on the job, sources said.

""It's just very clear everybody was afraid to speak up,"" said one former employee.

One worker who left Rideau Hall citing harassment said the job wasn't worth the damage it did to their self-worth.

""It's not just a matter of bad workplace dynamics,"" said the source. ""There's actual harassment and abuse ... It was just so tense that ... I almost just wanted to hide the whole time I was there.

""Life's too short. I don't want to come to work in the morning and spend the day feeling like I'm going to cry or not feeling like I could speak up.""

In the statement to CBC News, the Governor General's press secretary said Rideau Hall has a lower than average employee turnover rate when compared to other federal departments.

""Our staff take great pride in their work and enjoy a challenging and dynamic workplace,"" said Smith.

""In fact, the OSGG has a lower-than-average employee turnover when compared to other federal departments. One of the benefits of the federal public service is that individuals have the ability to move across different departments, seek promotions, and gain new and valuable career experiences, something that is personally encouraged by the Governor General, who believes that career growth and opportunity are vitally important.""

One source defended Payette, saying she has high standards and had reasons for her disappointment in staff. The source said Payette has approached the job on a much more personal level than past governors general, citing her decision to bike with the public on Canada Day in defiance of typical safety protocols.

The Globe and Mail has reported Payette has been at odds with the RCMP over security measures in the past.

A lack of oversight and safeguards

The harassment claims raise questions about the degree of oversight and accountability at Rideau Hall. The office benefits from Crown privileges and is exempt from access to information laws.

Like other federal employees, the Governor General's staff members can talk in confidence to an ombudsman with Public Services Procurement Canada. But it's not part of the ombudsman's mandate to register complaints or launch investigations. At most, the ombudsman can raise issues to the most senior person within the department — in this case, Di Lorenzo.

Employees can turn to Rideau Hall's own human resources office, but it's a closed loop: the complaints go to Di Lorenzo, who reports to the Governor General.

""It's soul-destroying,"" said one source. ""There's no one to complain to. There's no recourse. There's no one to report to without getting yourself into a reasonable amount of trouble or potentially losing your job.""

Payette's press secretary defended Rideau Hall's HR process and said no formal complaints regarding harassment have been made.

""We are proud of our stringent internal processes for our employees to voice concerns, through the staffing of a robust and accessible human resources department, an independent ombudsman, in addition to maintaining excellent relationships with the unions that represent our employees, whom have additional processes for the protection and support of federal public servants,"" said Smith.

Sources who spoke with the CBC said, however, that in some cases managers have told staff there isn't anything they can do about the harassment because they're victims of that same harassment.

Philippe Lagassé, an associate professor at Carleton University and an expert on the Westminster parliamentary system, said Canadians would benefit from greater transparency in vice regal offices like Rideau Hall.

""That's a long-standing issue that we've had,"" he said.

In fact, he said, the one person who could intervene and talk to Payette about human resource matters is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""The prime minister is responsible and accountable for all acts of the Governor General and everything that happens at Rideau Hall,"" said Lagassé.

""If there is concern about how the office is operating, that would have to come from the prime minister to the Governor General and a remedy would be found between them and their offices.""

25115,2020-07-21 15:52,"'Chair Girl' fined $2,000, given 2 years' probation, community service","A young woman who made headlines with a viral videotaped toss of a chair from a 45th-storey balcony in Toronto was fined $2,000 on Tuesday, with the judge saying it was lucky no one was hurt.

In passing sentence, Ontario court Judge Mara Greene rejected prosecution calls to jail Marcella Zoia, who was 19 at the time.

""I cannot find that she intended to hurt anyone when she threw that chair,"" Greene said.

In addition to the fine, which Greene called significant, Zoia will have to put in 150 hours of community service and will be on probation for two years.

Zoia had pleaded guilty to mischief endangering life in the February 2019 incident. The chair crashed near a woman with a child in a stroller but no one was injured.

A video of the incident went viral after being posted to social media, drawing widespread condemnation, and led to Zoia's being dubbed ""Chair Girl.""

The Crown had wanted a six-month jail sentence. Greene, who said Zoia was clearly playing to the cameras, said a suspended sentence as the defence had asked for was also inappropriate.

In the sentencing hearing, conducted by conference call due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Greene said the fact that no one was hurt played into her decision. She also said Zoia's young age and potential for rehabilitation mitigated against a jail term.

Evidence at trial was that Zoia had been drinking the night before and was still intoxicated on the morning she threw the chair off the high-rise balcony. The video was taken with her phone but Greene made no finding as to who had actually filmed it.

The video was deleted hours later, but had already made the rounds on social media and garnered international notoriety. Zoia turned herself in days after Toronto police asked for help in identifying her.

Zoia's lawyer, Greg Leslie, said earlier that his client had dropped out of school, lost modelling contracts, and was suffering from anxiety. She also had a major drinking problem, he said. He argued his client was immature and had succumbed to peer pressure.

The prosecution, however, had maintained Zoia had minimized the gravity of the incident.

Zoia had previously apologized in court for the incident.

""I'm sorry. A lot of people could have been seriously hurt because of my actions,"" Zoia said. ""I know this was a very immature and stupid mistake which I will take responsibility for.""

The judge ordered Zoia to follow any counselling regimen her probation officer might order.

25118,2020-07-21 15:47,Man in P.E.I. jailed for allegedly failing to self-isolate after COVID-19 diagnosis,"A man who tested positive for COVID-19 is in custody facing criminal charges after allegedly not self-isolating, says P.E.I.'s director of prosecutions.

John Diamond said Javan Mizero Nsangira, 22, was sent to the Rodd Brudenell River Resort last Wednesday to self-isolate for 14 days after his positive diagnosis. On Friday morning, Kings District RCMP responded to a call from resort staff indicating he was not abiding by public health measures.

RCMP Sgt. Chris Gunn said when police arrived at the resort, they found a man on the front lawn. Gunn said he was arrested and later charged with committing a common nuisance by endangering the life, safety or health of the public, as well as with uttering threats.

An RCMP officer was required to self-isolate because he came in close contact with the man. Gunn said the officer was tested and his result has come back negative.

Resort designated an isolation site

Nsangira appeared in provincial court on Monday via telephone. He did not enter a plea, and his next court appearance is scheduled for July 30.

Diamond said Nsangira was arrested on a domestic matter last Wednesday morning in Charlottetown and released on his own recognizance. Because he had tested positive for COVID-19, he was sent to Brudenell, which the province has been using as an isolation site for those who need one, such as temporary foreign workers.

He was given an opportunity to self isolate at Brudenell, didn't like that, and as a result the police had limited options what to do with him. — John Diamond

Diamond said that Nsangira himself is not a temporary foreign worker.

""He was given an opportunity to self-isolate at Brudenell, didn't like that and as a result the police had limited options what to do with him,"" the prosecutor said.

""And as a result, since he was being non-compliant with self-isolation and basically creating a risk to the general population, he had to be placed in a facility such as the correctional facility.""

Though Nsangira remains in custody, Dr. Heather Morrison, P.E.I.'s chief public health officer, said at her news briefing on Tuesday that there are currently no positive cases at the provincial jail.

Morrison has declined to comment on the health of any specific individual during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the province's most recent statistics show that two people who were still testing positive on the weekend are now classified as recovered, leaving just three active cases.

Refusing to self-isolate beings $1,000 fine

Nsangira has also been fined $1,000 under the province's Public Health Act for not complying with the directive to self-isolate.

He is one of 34 people who have been fined for not self-isolating in line with public health coronavirus instructions. Three others have gone to court, all leading to convictions. Two more cases are scheduled for August.

Diamond said he's not overly surprised that people are contesting fines for not self-isolating, given that they amount to $1,000. ""People have the right to have their day in court.""

He said, however, that the series of charges is showing that the province takes COVID-19 health measures seriously.

""The people that are doing the enforcement are taking it seriously, doing proper investigations and providing the information to the courts, and then the court has the ability to make a determination,"" Diamond said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-man-jailed-brudenell-1.5657398?cmp=rss,news,canada,prince-edward-island
25117,2020-07-21 15:36,AMA holding 'confidence vote' on Shandro as doctors' battle with health minister escalates,"The Alberta Medical Association is asking its members to vote on whether or not they have confidence in Health Minister Tyler Shandro's ability to work with them as the relationship between physicians and the UCP government continues to sour.

""Our relationship with the provincial government has reached an all-time low,"" said AMA president Dr. Christine Molnar in a letter to the membership.

""We are in unprecedented times, and by an overwhelming majority, [our leadership committee] took the step of requesting a confidence vote referendum on the minister of health.""

Shandro and the AMA have been locked in an increasingly public and acrimonious battle since the United Conservative government terminated the provinces' physician compensation agreement with the AMA in February.

It did so as it ramped up efforts to reform the health-care system and limit the increasing cost of physician services.

The AMA is suing the provincial government for $250 million over the termination of the master agreement.

""For months now, the AMA has repeatedly attempted to engage the minister of health in an honest and fair negotiation with physicians,"" Molnar said in her letter.

""At every turn, we have been met with a combination of indifference and increasing hostility. It is damaging your practices, our health-care system and patient care every day that it continues.""

Earlier this month, a survey by the Alberta Medical Association suggested 42 per cent of the 1,740 doctors who responded are planning to leave the province due to changes in how they are paid.

Shandro then threatened to start publicly disclosing the billings of individual physicians.

Shandro has also directed the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta to change its standards of practice for physicians in an attempt to stop the province's doctors from leaving their practices en masse due to the ongoing dispute over pay.

Molnar said if the results of the online vote show that AMA members do have confidence in Shandro, the association will continue efforts to work with him.

""There's never been a previous minister of health that the AMA has not been able to successfully negotiate an agreement with,"" Molnar told CBC News.

If the vote shows members don't have confidence in Shandro, the AMA will push for Premier Jason Kenney to step in.

""We are very interested in getting talking to government and finding a way through the impasse and getting to a negotiated agreement that will set Alberta's health-care system on a path forward during this difficult economic time,"" Molnar said in the interview.

The online vote will be open until July 28 at 11 p.m.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/shandro-vote-referendum-ama-confidence-health-minister-alberta-premier-1.5657598?cmp=rss,news,canada,calgary
25124,2020-07-21 15:34,"City council in Kenora,  Ont., votes down contentious loitering bylaw","A proposed loitering bylaw for Kenora, Ont., was defeated by city council at its meeting Tuesday.

The bylaw lost by a vote of 6-1 with Coun. Chris Van Walleghem casting the only vote in favour.

If passed, the bylaw would have allowed police to ticket people if they were found loitering on public property in the northwestern Ontario city. The ticket carried a fine of $100.

Prior to Tuesday's vote, the proposed bylaw drew criticism from First Nations leaders and community activists throughout the region over concerns it would unfairly target Kenora's homeless and transient people, most of whom are Indigenous, and many who suffer from mental health and addictions issues.

Speaking before the vote at Tuesday's meeting, several councillors echoed those concerns.

""In my mind, it's no longer about a loitering bylaw,"" said Coun. Sharon Smith. ""It's clear from the mail I have received this bylaw is about symbolism.""

""It is reminiscent of the 1970s,"" she said. ""It recalls bad government policy, loss of lands, culture and sustainability, residential schools, [the] 60s Scoop, stolen children, and much more.""

Smith said the proposed bylaw would be ""hurtful to many.""

Coun. Andrew Poirier said he initially supported the bylaw, but emails and phone calls received by council had changed his mind.

However, Poirier said crime remains a major issue in downtown Kenora, and it needs to be addressed.

""We've heard from a lot of people,"" he said at Tuesday's meeting. ""Talk is cheap. We still, without this bylaw, have an issue downtown that everybody's aware of.""

""Now's the time for everybody to step up and try and solve this problem.""

Coun. Kirsi Ralko said she hopes the debate around the bylaw will ""catalyze"" people to get involved, and work to solve Kenora's homelessness and addictions issues, which contribute to crime in the city's downtown area.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/kenora-loitering-bylaw-defeated-1.5657709?cmp=rss,news,canada,thunder-bay
25141,2020-07-21 15:19,"Paying volunteer students less than minimum wage was federal government's idea, says WE Charity","As the Commons finance committee prepares for more testimony on the controversial Canada Student Service Grant, WE Charity says one of the more contentious aspects of the program's design — paying students less than minimum wage for their hours of work — was the federal government's idea.

With only about six weeks left before their return to full-time studies, some students now say they want the federal government to scrap the stalled $900 million volunteer compensation scheme and redirect the funding toward financial assistance for post-secondary students and recent graduates.

CBC News asked WE Charity whether organizations that supervised volunteers could decide on their own to adjust how they counted their volunteers' hours if they were concerned about students not being paid fairly.

""The Government of Canada determined the compensation per hour of service for the CSSG, and WE Charity was contracted to administer CSSG according to that decision,"" WE Charity told CBC News.

Co-founders of WE Craig (left) and Marc Kielburger (right) are seen on stage during WE Day California in Inglewood, California, U.S. April 25, 2019. (Reuters)

The government's decision to partner with WE Charity to administer the grant has sparked controversy since the program launched on June 25. WE has close personal ties to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family and his role in selecting it is now the subject of a probe by Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion.

The program was set up in five tiers, with students qualifying for $1,000 in grant money for every block of 100 hours worked, up to a maximum of $5,000 for 500 hours.

That works out to a maximum hourly rate of $10 per hour — less than the minimum wage in any Canadian jurisdiction.

Legal experts have warned organizations that they could violate employment codes , like Ontario's Employment Standards Act, by taking on volunteers under the Canada Student Service Grant.

One potential host organization suggested to CBC News it was considering counting four hours of volunteering as six for the purpose of calculating the grant, in order to compensate students at a rate closer to $15 an hour.

'Red flags'

Senior bureaucrats appearing before the Commons finance committee last Thursday explained WE Charity's original agreement to administer the volunteer grant.

WE withdrew from its contract on July 3 , a decision Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's office called ""mutual.""

Gina Wilson, Chagger's senior associate deputy minister, said that in a partnership agreement like the one it had with the WE organization, the government sets performance measures and audits the results but ""does not direct or dictate how the recipient will carry out the project.""

""Contribution agreements lay out the funding and the broad policy objectives ... the desired results. Then it is for the third party to make decisions about how they achieve those results,"" Rachel Wernick, a senior assistant deputy minister at Employment and Social Development Canada, told the committee.

Nevertheless, WE Charity was not in charge of designing how the program would compensate students.

Things like the value of the grant, or how often students would be required to volunteer, were decided upon by the government, Chagger's office told CBC News Monday. WE's administrative role involved getting students to sign up and recruiting organizations to supervise them.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus asked Chagger during her committee testimony last week if her office sought a legal opinion about having students do work that pays less than the minimum wage — something he suggested should have raised ""red flags"" because it might not be legal and could leave charities liable.

""I'm confident that the public service would have done their due diligence and would have requested legal opinions,"" the minister said, after Angus accused her of throwing civil servants ""under the bus.""

""I think what's important to note is the difference between employment opportunities and volunteer opportunities. This was about service opportunities within communities,"" Chagger said.

Grant design was 'like Air Miles'

Angus later asked Wernick if her department sought a legal opinion.

""I need to clarify that this was a lump sum financial award like a bursary at the end of the summer. It was not an hourly wage and that was the nature of the grant,"" Wernick said.

""Rewards are like that. Like Air Miles, you have to reach certain levels before you get a reward,"" Wernick said later, adding she could not talk about the government's legal advice because it would ""constitute advice to ministers and solicitor-client privilege.""

Paula Speevak, the president and CEO of Volunteer Canada, told the committee that in late April she met with senior officials from Chagger's office and shared concerns expressed by her member organizations about ""paying an hourly rate for community service that is below minimum wage and calling this volunteering.""

""This could create the wrong message about volunteering and potentially undermine volunteer engagement in the future,"" said Speevak. ""There are also issues related to insurance — confusion about whether someone is covered as a volunteer or as an employee, and how that works.""

Because of its national network of volunteer centres and its expertise in volunteer engagement, Volunteer Canada was offered $100,000 to sub-contract as a ""strategic partner"" under WE Charity, Speevak said.

It declined.

Rollout 'bungled,' students prefer direct help

""I'm a big fan of volunteering, but this program really steps over the line of what we can consider volunteering,"" said Spencer Julien, a University of Toronto student. ""It's not volunteering when there's monetary compensation.

""It's unfortunate that the government thinks that the only way to incentivize young people to go out and help in their communities is by bribing them with this grant.""

Julien speaks for the #DontForgetStudents campaign. Since April, it's been asking the federal government to provide students with the same amount of emergency relief benefits it offers other workers affected by the pandemic: $2,000 a month, instead of the current $1,250.

Julien said more students would be willing to volunteer if they weren't so worried about how to pay for school — and paying them $10 an hour is ""an affront to workers and the progress workers have made.

""We could go and work at Loblaws for more than this would offer us.""

Julien's group is launching a petition Tuesday, joining the Canadian Federation of Students in calling for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit to be extended to international students and those who graduated in fall 2019.

Although the Canada Student Grant has been doubled for this fall, the federal government should also work with provinces and territories toward even more tuition relief, the groups say.

But students' most serious problems are less about tuition and more about the cost of living in the cities where they need to be for their studies, Julien said.

""The government has completely bungled the rollout of this program,"" Julien said, adding there's not enough time now for the public service to save it.

""The government has an opportunity to make up for what it should have done in the first place.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/student-aid-volunteer-we-charity-trudeau-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-1.5656622,news,politics,student-aid-volunteer-we-charity-trudeau-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-1.5656622

25114,2020-07-21 15:00,Brides denied service from videographer who doesn't film 'homosexual weddings',"As soon as Mallory Arthur and Kelly Roberts got engaged in January, they started planning their October 2021 wedding.

""Two brides are better than one,"" said Arthur, who met her fiancée six years ago. ""More exciting that way.""

But this week's excitement wasn't what the Woodstock, Ont., couple, both 26 years old, were bargaining for. When they tried to book videographer Caramount Pictures, based in Brantford, Ont., for their wedding, the owner told them the business will not work with a same-sex couple.

The refusal came on Monday, 15 years to the day after Canada legalized same-sex marriage, on July 20, 2005.

""I say this with much care, because I know your union is incredibly important to you, but we do not film homosexual weddings,"" Cara Hamstra, the business owner, wrote in an email.

'My heart just immediately dropped'

Arthur was shocked. ""She was so blunt about it, didn't even try to mask it,"" she said.

""When I opened the email, my heart just immediately dropped. I felt sick to my stomach,"" Roberts said. ""It was just so blatant what she said. And usually people will try and dance around it.""

CBC News reached out to Hamstra for comment but has not received a response as of publication.

The couple had a similar experience in February.

Roberts said after meeting with a wedding officiant in a local Tim Hortons doughnut shop, he said he wouldn't marry the two women.

""Mallory was grabbing us a coffee, and as she sat down and he realized it was two women, he said that his beliefs don't support our marriage, and he would be shunned by the church if he married us,"" she said.

Kelly Roberts and Mallory Arthur, of Woodstock, Ont., are planning their wedding for Oct. 2, 2021. 'She's just my favourite person in the world, and I can't wait to marry her,"" Arthur says. (Days Like This Photography)

Susan Toth, a lawyer in London, Ont. — about 55 kilometres southwest of Woodstock — said denying someone service because of their sexual orientation is a human rights violation.

""If a private organization is specifically identifying sexual orientation as the basis for refusal of a private service, then this would violate the [Ontario] Human Rights Code,"" Toth said.

""There are exceptions for special-interest organizations, such as religious clubs or schools, but this would normally not extend to a private business.""

In one case, a private Christian organization was allowed to bar a young student from enrolling in its school because the parents were in a same-sex marriage. The Ontario Human Rights Tribunal upheld the group's decision because the school fell under the category of a special-interest organization.

""I don't see that applying here, though,"" Toth said.

Same-sex marriage legal for 15 years

On July 20, 2005, Canada officially legalized same-sex marriage.

""It almost just makes you question how far we've actually come,"" Roberts said. ""You'd think by now things are a little more accepting. To receive that right after Pride Month, something we actively celebrate, is just sad. I'm just shocked and sad.""

For the most part, Arthur said, planning the wedding has been a positive experience. ""We were hoping that in 2020, it would be pretty smooth sailing, which for the most part it really has been,"" she said.

""A lot of the vendors that we've booked have been great and very accepting of us,"" she said. ""So we've still had the brides-planning-their-wedding excitement. It's just been these couple vendors that really throw a wrench in things, and it's just shocking.""

Roberts said she wants to make people aware that there are still businesses that will deny service based on sexual orientation.

Mallory Arthur and Kelly Roberts of Woodstock, Ont. got engaged earlier this year and were excited to plan their wedding. When they reached out to Brantford company Caramount Pictures, ""we do not film homosexual weddings."" They describe what happened to London Morning. 7:56

""I don't want anyone else to have to face such a blatant rejection to their face. I think that can be very upsetting for someone to receive. It might break someone's spirit to hear something like that,"" she said.

The couple is still excited to get married. ""I don't think anyone could bring it down,"" Roberts said. ""I'm just I'm so excited to marry Mallory. This really sucks and I wish it didn't happen, but at the end of the day, I still get to marry Mallory. And I know that sounds so corny, but I'm truly just excited she's my best friend.""

Arthur echoed the sentiment. ""She's just my favourite person in the world, and I can't wait to marry her.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/same-sex-couple-brides-denied-service-1.5657191?cmp=rss,news,canada,london
25140,2020-07-21 15:00,"1,193 cases and counting: Rising COVID-19 numbers 'very concerning,' Alberta premier says","With case numbers on the rise over the past few days, Premier Jason Kenney had a blunt message for Albertans who have stopped following public health guidelines intended to slow the spread of coronavirus.

""Knock it off!,"" Kenney said at a new conference where the province reported two more COVID-19 deaths and 141 new cases of the illness.

The latest update from Alberta Health shows the province has reported 509 new cases over the past four days.

""We should all be very concerned about the recent rise in active COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Alberta,"" Kenney said, moments before he announced that 750,000 K-12 students will be heading back to school at the end of the summer.

The premier said Albertans have made ""countless sacrifices"" to slow the spread of coronavirus and protect the people who are most vulnerable.

""But it looks like some folks are no longer observing the public health guidelines,"" Kenney said.

""Maybe that's because some people have just become tired of this whole thing, and we could all understand that. Or some believe that the threat of COVID-19 is exaggerated. Maybe some young healthy people aren't worried about getting sick themselves.

""But whatever the reasons, the results are troubling. And so today, I plead with Albertans not to give up on the progress that we've made. The last thing we want to have to do is reimpose damaging restrictions on our economy and our freedoms.""

The COVID-19 pandemic likely won't be over for months, the premier said.

""So let me be blunt. If you think you can socialize with large groups of people in close quarters, knock it off. If you're young and healthy, remember you could still carry and transmit the virus that ends up killing someone who is old or vulnerable.""

Kenney urged people to ""get back to the basics,"" washing or sanitizing their hands frequently, staying home if they're sick, maintaining two metres of physical distance whenever possible, and wearing masks where that's not possible.

""We're not expecting perfection. Probably no one is going to follow all of these guidelines all of the time. But let's just do our best to show care for others. That's the Alberta way.""

Most active cases in months

The most recent reported deaths were a woman in her 80s in the Calgary zone and a woman in her 70s, whose death was linked to an outbreak at the Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre in Edmonton.

That brings the total number of deaths to 172.

As of Tuesday's update, the province had 1,193 active cases of COVID-19, the highest total seen in more than two months.

Across the province, 93 people are in hospital being treated for the illness, 16 of them in ICU beds.

The regional breakdown of active cases on Tuesday was:

Calgary zone: 589 cases.

Edmonton zone: 233 cases.

Central zone: 145 cases.

South zone: 131 cases.

North zone: 89 cases.

Unknown: six cases.

Kenney was joined at the podium by Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, and Education Minister Adriana LaGrange, who offered details about the province's plan to return to in-school classes for the 2020-21 school year.

Hinshaw echoed the premier's words, saying she too is concerned about the continued rise in active cases and is watching the situation closely.

""COVID-19 isn't going anywhere,"" she said. ""It's on all of us to adopt the public health guidance and protect each other. This weekend, beaches around the province showed us that this is possible. Two weeks ago, we had widespread reports of overcrowding, inadequate physical distancing and general disregard for public health measures in place.

""Last weekend, we saw clear improvements, thanks to co-ordinated efforts by beach communities like Sylvan Lake, Chestermere and Alberta Beach, as well as health officials and law enforcement.""

Since the start of the pandemic in March, Alberta laboratories have conducted 598,317 tests, a rate of more than 115,000 tests per one million population.

25116,2020-07-21 14:55,"Virus antibodies fade fast, but not necessarily protection","New research suggests that antibodies the immune system makes to fight the new coronavirus may only last a few months in people with mild illness, but that doesn't mean protection also is gone or that it won't be possible to develop an effective vaccine.

""Infection with this coronavirus does not necessarily generate lifetime immunity,"" but antibodies are only part of the story, said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. He had no role in the work, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The immune system remembers how to make fresh antibodies if needed and other parts of it also can mount an attack, he said.

Antibodies are proteins that white blood cells called B cells make to bind to the virus and help eliminate it. The earliest ones are fairly crude but as infection goes on, the immune system becomes trained to focus its attack and to make more precise antibodies.

Dr. Otto Yang and others at the University of California, Los Angeles, measured these more precise antibodies in 30 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and four housemates presumed to have the disease. Their average age was 43 and most had mild symptoms.

WATCH | Questions surround lasting immunity

A new study on COVID-19 immunity has found that people who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic had their antibodies diminish within two to three months. Though larger studies are needed, the findings cast doubt on antibody testing and herd immunity. 2:01

Researchers found that the antibodies had a half-life of 73 days, which means that half of them would be gone after that much time. It dovetails with a previous report from China also suggesting antibodies quickly fade.

The results ""call for caution regarding antibody-based 'immunity passports,' herd immunity, and perhaps vaccine durability,"" the California authors write.

That's true, Creech said, but other parts of the immune system also help confer protection. Besides churning out antibodies, B cells develop a memory so they know how to do that again if needed.

""They would get called into action very quickly when there's a new exposure to the virus. It's as if they lie dormant, just waiting,"" he said.

Other white blood cells called T cells also are better able to attack the virus the next time they see it, Creech said.

Vaccines could protect for longer

Although circulating antibodies may not last long, what we need to know is if and how people remake antibodies if exposed to the coronavirus again and if they protect against another infection, Alison Criss, an immunologist at the University of Virginia, wrote in an email. ""We also need to know if there is a protective T cell response"" that reappears.

Vaccines, which provoke the immune system to make antibodies, might give longer-lasting protection than natural infection because they use purified versions of what stimulates that response, she noted.

Creech agreed.

""This shouldn't dissuade us from pursuing a vaccine,"" he said. ""Antibodies are only a part of the story.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid19-antibodies-nejm-1.5657666?cmp=rss,news,health,
25100,2020-07-21 14:51,CEOs of 200 Canadian companies pledge to support 'BlackNorth' diversity initiative,"CEOs representing more than 200 Canadian organizations, including three of Canada's big banks, have signed up to support the BlackNorth Initiative against systemic racism.

A list of the signatories was released Monday for an online summit of Canadian business leaders, who have pledged to create conditions to support the success of members of the Black community.

The BlackNorth Initiative is led by Wes Hall, executive chairman and founder of Kingsdale Advisors, which advises many of Canada's large publicly traded companies.

""Anti-Black systemic racism has to end,"" Hall said. ""As business leaders, we must be aware that (systemic racism) has a material impact on our business, our Black employees and their families.""

The summit opened with comments from Hall in an interview-style presentation that was broadcast online from a theatre in Toronto.

Hall said that even though he is a successful Black businessman, he and his family can't avoid the effect of systemic racism.

""I live in a nice neighbourhood and the repairman comes to my house and he would say, 'Go get Mr. Hall, please,"" Hall said.

""Or I'm driving to work (and) on a conference call with the chairman of the board of one of my clients and I get pulled over because my car is too nice.""

Positive change

Hall said that 2020 could be remembered for ""what COVID did to us all"" or as the year that anti-Black systemic racism came to an end in Canada.

The goal of the BlackNorth Initiative is to use the same type of collective effort that has been used against the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.

Hall's co-chairs for the summit were Cisco Canada's Rola Dagher, CIBC's Victor Dodig and Fairfax Financial's Prem Watsa, who are all chief executives of their organizations.

25101,2020-07-21 14:50,Amber Heard denies fabricating injuries in Johnny Depp's U.K. libel trial,"Amber Heard spent most of her second day of evidence in Johnny Depp's libel case against a British tabloid dismissing accusations that she fabricated allegations of domestic violence against her ex-husband.

Taking to the witness box Tuesday at the High Court in London, the actor faced a barrage of questions over alleged incidents that are central to The Sun's labelling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a ""wife beater.""

Depp, 57, is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard and was at the court to hear his ex-wife's testimony.

His lawyer, Eleanor Laws, sought to show inconsistencies in Heard's allegations, accusing her of weaving a ""web of lies.""

""You're making this up as you go along at times,"" Laws said to Heard, to which the actor, 34, replied: ""All this happened to me and I remember it.""

Laws made much of a series of video clips from an elevator at the couple's Los Angeles apartment building that she claimed showed no evidence of any injuries on Heard's face after an incident on May 21, 2016, which ended with police arriving on the scene.

Laws also wondered why others in the building did not notice injuries in the days after.

Heard has alleged that Depp threw a phone at her ""like he was a baseball pitcher,"" hitting her on the right cheek and eye.

Heard said she wore makeup when leaving home that could have camouflaged any injury.

""Of course I had an injury,"" she said.

Heard denies 'illicit relationships' with Tesla CEO, actor

Laws also questioned Heard about text messages she sent Depp in the days after the alleged incident and about why she hadn't filed a restraining order immediately.

""I thought it could stay under wraps for a few days and those few days were a precious few days in the hardest time of my life, and presumably difficult for Johnny as well, and I would have done anything to have those few days of privacy,"" Heard said.

Heard also denied she had an ""illicit relationship"" with anyone during her time with Depp, specifically with either Tesla CEO Elon Musk or actor James Franco. ""Not that that matters much,"" she said.

Laws read out text messages from May 22, 2016, in which Heard allegedly tells Musk she is going to obtain a restraining order against Depp, and the billionaire offers to ""arrange 24/7 security.""

Musk allegedly said the offer would stand, ""even if you never wanted to see me again ... anyway, sorry for being an idiot. The radio silence hurts a lot. It only matters because I really like you.""

On Monday, during her first day of testimony, Heard accused her ex-husband of abusing her both physically and verbally while he was allegedly bingeing on alcohol and drugs, claiming that at various times during their tempestuous relationship she feared for her life.

Depp and Heard met on the set of the comedy The Rum Diary, released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.

In the first nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who backed his version of events.

In his testimony, Depp said he was the one being abused by Heard and that she had a history of being violent against him.

Via audio recordings of the couple discussing various incidents played in court, Depp's lawyer sought to show that Heard admitted she had been violent against Depp. Heard said any contact was purely self-defence.

""That is what happens when you are in this situation, that's the truth,"" she said.

""I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him. My job was to say sorry and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.""

Heard said she hit Depp to defend her sister

She said the first time she struck Depp was in March 2015 but that she only did so to defend her sister, Whitney, for fear he would throw her down the stairs as she alleged he had done to model Kate Moss when they dated in the 1990s.

Heard said the ""information"" was ""fresh"" in her mind at the time of the alleged incident and that she reacted ""in a flash"" to protect her sister.

Depp's counsel wondered why Heard had not mentioned the Moss allegation in her deposition.

""I've not had the liberty of time or space or energy even to list every thought that crossed my mind,"" Heard said.

Heard denied the allegation made in court in the first week of the trial that she, or one of her friends, defecated on the couple's bed the morning after her 30th birthday party in April 2016.

""That's absolutely disgusting,"" Heard said. ""I can't imagine what kind of human being would have a sense of humour like that, other than Johnny, but I don't think that's funny, I think it's horrific.""

Heard suggested the feces came from one of their Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, noting that Boo had issues ever since he had allegedly eaten some of Depp's marijuana as a puppy, or as she phrased it ""since the weed.""

In written testimony released to the court, Heard said that at various times during their relationship she endured ""punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking.""

She said some incidents were ""so severe"" she was ""afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far.""

According to Heard, Depp ""explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship.""

She said he blamed his actions on ""a self-created third party"" that he referred to as ""the monster.""

Heard's testimony is expected to last for four days, through Thursday",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/depp-heard-uk-libel-trial-1.5657648?cmp=rss,news,entertainment,

Board Chair Janice Agrios and president and CEO Chris Presson will make a major announcement at 1:15 p.m., the team said in a news release.

Media reports, unverified by CBC, have suggested the CFL club has come to an internal decision to change its name, with an announcement expected as early as this week.

The team's current name, Eskimos, has been criticized as insensitive or even racist.

Sponsors of the team have threatened to cut ties unless the organization commits to changing its name.

Last week, the National Football League team in Washington announced it will retire its name and logo after pressure from sponsors.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-cfl-team-to-make-major-announcement-1.5657661?cmp=rss,news,canada,edmonton
25113,2020-07-21 14:39,Edmonton CFL team will officially change its name,"Edmonton's professional football team is changing its name.

""The Edmonton Eskimo Football Club board of directors has made the decision to discontinue the use of the word 'Eskimo' in the team's name,"" a news release said Tuesday.

At a news conference Tuesday, Board Chair Janice Agrios said the team's most recent opinion research showed that views about the name are shifting quickly.

""People who defended the name only a year ago are less comfortable with it now. Institutions are being renamed around the world. The change to our name is part of a sweeping societal change.""

Agrios also spoke about the team's identity.

""To those of us who spent our formative years bundling up to sit in the stands and cheer on our team in below-zero temperatures, the name Eskimos meant tough, resilient, never give up. It also meant community and respect. We identified with this name.

""In recent years, however, we've come to understand the concerns with the name. We know that those who originally named the team did not intend to be disrespectful or derogatory — in fact, the very opposite.

""They were proud to associate themselves with such a resilient northern people. The alliteration of the two words, our northern location — the name felt like a natural fit.

""However, while we might relate to Inuit values, that doesn't mean we can continue to use this name.""

Name search process

The team will begin a ""comprehensive engagement process"" to find a new name.

Team president and CEO Chris Presson called the name change a monumental, historic occasion in the history of the team.

He believes fans will continue to support the club no matter the name.

""This is tough for long-time fans, no question, but here's the thing: we're all a team. Our team, and game day itself, are designed to unite people.

""Our game is designed to bring people together for a half day so they can leave their worries and struggles behind.

""Now, more than ever, we all need a mental break. We need unity, not divisiveness.""

The process will involve research and ""input from season seat holders, casual ticket purchasers and partners,"" the team said.

""We're not very far down that path yet,"" Presson said. ""I can't give you a specific timeline or process, but the chance to choose a new name for the future of this team, a name that captures those Edmonton values, that's a great opportunity. We don't have a new name yet, but the list of possibilities is growing every day.""

The team said the green-and-gold team colours and the EE logo will be part of the discussions.

In the meantime, the club will use the names EE Football Team and Edmonton Football Team.

The team's current name has been criticized as insensitive or even racist.

Sponsors of the team have threatened to cut ties unless the organization commits to changing its name.

25120,2020-07-21 14:03,Homeless people in tents fight Toronto parks bylaw amid COVID-19 pandemic,"A Toronto bylaw banning tents and camping in city parks should be declared unconstitutional given the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of homeless people and activist organizations argue in a new court application.

The untested application, filed in Superior Court this week, asserts that city threats to evict them violates their rights and demands a halt to any attempts to remove them from the parks.

Among other things, the bylaw prohibits people from being in, camping or living in parks after midnight. While enforcement provisions require 72 hours notice before an eviction, the city threatened to kick them out last week within 24 hours.

""The applicants view their ability to erect a tent or shelter within their community and to store their essential belongings as integral to their ability to safely shelter in place in the midst of a global pandemic so long as they are homeless,"" they say.

According to the urgent filing, the bylaw prevents the homeless from ""engaging in essential life-sustaining activities"" in public places.

Forcing them into communal indoor spaces puts them at risk, they say.

City postpones Moss Park evictions

""Depriving homeless people of the ability to provide themselves with safe, warm, dry shelter in public spaces in Toronto exposes the applicants and other homeless individuals to additional health and safety risks,"" they say. ""It also causes serious state-imposed stress.""

A city spokesman said on Tuesday it was reviewing the application. Brad Ross said evictions had been put on hold in the interim, but said encampments still present safety risks.

""Overdose, open flames, generators, propane tanks, and lack of access to water and sanitation increase health and safety risks for individuals living in encampments,"" Ross said.

Derrick Black and his partner Michelle Plourd, who live in one of the encampments, are being represented in the court application filed against the city arguing that Toronto's bylaw banning tents and camping in city parks should be considered 'unconstitutional.' (Lorenda Reddekopp/CBC)

In addition, he said, the city had permanently housed more than 1,300 homeless people since mid-March. It has also moved at least 550 others from 43 encampments to inside safe spaces such as interim housing, hotels and shelter, he added.

Outbreaks in shelters

According to the applicants, at least 630 people in the city's shelter and respite system have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. More than three-dozen outbreaks have occurred in shelter sites and the issue is the subject of a separate court challenge, the filing states.

The more than a dozen applicants had put up tents or other shelters in various city parks — Moss Park and Allan Lamport Park for example — for protection from the elements, privacy, and to store personal belongings. Some have been in the parks since March, when the province and city declared states of emergency due to the global pandemic.

City staff have offered to house them in hotels or other temporary facilities but they have resisted on the grounds they feel unsafe in an indoor communal setting, where physical distancing is difficult.

""The location of many of these spaces is often inaccessible and far from the communities where the applicants and other encampment residents live,"" the filing states. ""They are far from necessary and familiar services such as overdose prevention sites, pharmacists, doctors, social and outreach workers.""

They also argue rules in alternative settings, such as curfews and the demand for abstinence from substances, are ""excessively paternalistic"" and do not meet their needs.

Advocates note full shelters were already turning people away before the epidemic, a situation exacerbated by COVID-19.

Many homeless people are members of disadvantaged groups, such as Black, Indigenous and the physically or mentally disabled.

""The parks bylaw has the effect of perpetuating or promoting the view that the homeless are less worthy of recognition or value as a human being or a member of Canadian society,"" the filing states.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/moss-park-eviction-encampment-1.5657363?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
25092,2020-07-21 13:42,Committee says Commons should prepare for remote voting this fall,"The parliamentary committee that oversees the way the House of Commons works says the chamber should spend the rest of the summer getting ready for MPs to participate and vote from outside of Ottawa.

The committee said in a report released Tuesday that COVID-19 likely will make it too dangerous for MPs to gather in large numbers when the Commons is due to resume its regular business in September — especially for those who need to travel long distances.

The committee wants to take the videoconferencing system MPs have been using for meetings over the last few months and add a secure voting system so that more normal business can be conducted — with some MPs physically present in Parliament and some not.

Since the House of Commons broke up as the COVID-19 pandemic hit Canada in March, it has used two primary meeting formats.

One is a special COVID-19 committee that meets in the Commons chamber. Any MP can participate in those committee meetings, and many have done so through videoconferencing. The COVID-19 committee can debate but it can't pass legislation.

The other format is occasional sittings of the House of Commons with very limited numbers of MPs present. In those sittings — two of which are taking place this week — MPs can pass legislation but only those in the chamber can participate.

The committee's recommendation is essentially to fuse the two formats so that MPs can participate virtually and hold meaningful votes.

Creating that voting mechanism will mean ""an iterative approach including multiple rounds of testing, demonstrations and adaptations,"" so that by the time September sittings come around, MPs are comfortable with the technology and everyone is confident it's safe to use.

High-quality audio gear needed

The committee also says all MPs and anyone else participating must be equipped with high-quality audio gear so they can be heard properly.

And the Commons will need to invest in its interpretation service because the people who do that work have been burning out trying to translate fast-talking MPs with poor internet connections.

Those poor internet connections are most likely to plague MPs representing more remote rural areas. The committee says the House of Commons should do what's necessary to fix them.

The Conservatives dissented from the committee's recommendations, saying it's better for a limited number of MPs to gather in Ottawa in person and avoid travelling while COVID-19 remains a worry.

""Of course, we recognize the COVID-19 pandemic requires us to change our routines,"" their dissenting report reads. ""However, the underlying currents, during this study, heading toward a remote voting app made us question, again, if 'a crisis was not being left to go to waste.""'

The Conservatives say the House of Commons would work better with a maximum of 86 MPs in the chamber at any one time — the largest number that can fit in the chamber while maintaining physical distancing.

If their fellow MPs do adopt the committee's recommendations, the Tories say they should expire automatically at the end of December unless there's a vote to renew them.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/proc-remote-voting-commons-covid19-1.5657497?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25095,2020-07-21 13:26,Oilers' Leon Draisaitl leads finalists for NHL's Hart Trophy as MVP,"Edmonton Oilers centre Leon Draisaitl, Colorado Avalanche centre Nathan MacKinnon and New York Rangers left-wing Artemi Panarin are the finalists for the 2020 Hart Trophy.

The awarded is presented each year by the NHL to ""the player adjudged to be the most valuable to his team.""

Draisaitl led the league with 110 points (43 goals, 67 assists) in 71 games, becoming the first German-born player to win the Art Ross Trophy.

He registered at least one point in 56 of his 71 appearances and recorded a league-best 33 multi-point performances.

The 24-year-old from Cologne, Germany, led the NHL in assists and power-play points (44) and was tied for first with 10 game-winning goals. He led NHL forwards in both total (1,605 minutes 24 seconds) and average (22:37) ice time.

In part 4 of 10, Rob Pizzo breaks down whether the Blackhawks could upset the Oilers. 1:05

Draisaitl is seeking to become the fourth Oiler to capture the award following Wayne Gretzky (eight times, most recently 1986-87), Mark Messier (1989-90) and Connor McDavid (2016-17).

MacKinnon ranked fifth in the NHL with 93 points (35 goals, 58 assists) in 69 games.

The 24-year-old from Cole Harbour, N.S., finished the campaign among the league leaders in shots on goal (first, 318), power-play points (fourth, 31), assists (sixth, 58), power-play goals (tied sixth, 12) and goals (ninth, 35).

MacKinnon recorded 43 more points than defenceman Cale Makar, his next-closest teammate. It's the largest differential between a team's top two scorers since the 2007-08 Washington Capitals, when Alex Ovechkin had 112 points and Nicklas Backstrom had 69.

MacKinnon's point total was aided by a 13-game, season-opening point streak, the longest such run by an Avalanche/Nordiques player since Mats Sundin's 30-game streak in 1992-93.

Panarin established a career high and ranked fourth in the NHL with 95 points (32 goals, 63 assists).

He topped the league with 46 even-strength assists and 71 even-strength points, while placing second in both assists (tied, 63) and plus/minus (plus-36).

Panarin also played a career-high 20:36 per game, including 3:44 on the power play, while logging a career-low 20 penalty minutes.

The 28-year-old Korkino, Russia, native is New York's first Hart Trophy finalist since 2011-12, when Henrik Lundqvist finished third in voting.

Panarin won the 2015-16 Calder Trophy in his rookie season with Chicago.

The three players are also the finalists for the Ted Lindsay award, presented annually to the ""most outstanding"" player in the NHL as voted by members of the National Hockey League Players' Association.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-awards-hart-trophy-1.5657536?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
25094,2020-07-21 13:25,Torstar shareholders give OK to $60M takeover despite other offer worth more on paper,"Torstar shareholders voted in favour of a $60 million takeover of the newspaper company, despite the presence of a second offer for the company that's worth more on paper.

The $60-million acquisition of the Torstar Corp. newspaper group by NordStar Capital LP was approved by shareholders Tuesday, despite a rival group's last-minute offer to increase its cash bid.

A preliminary count of votes tallied after a brief online meeting showed the deal recommended by Torstar's board received the necessary support from the company's shareholders.

Although the shareholder vote is a critical step in closing the deal, the transaction remains subject to regulatory and court approvals

The Ontario Securities Commission had received shareholder complaints after the original rival bid was made public but OSC spokeswoman Kate Ballotta said Tuesday that it can't comment further.

John Honderich, who chaired the online meeting, received no questions from shareholders Tuesday.

Honderich said during the meeting, which lasted about 10 minutes, that Torstar's board operated ""to the highest level of corporate governance"" and received ""excellent"" outside legal advice.

""I feel our process was very sound,"" Honderich said.

He also noted that any deal requires approval from the Torstar Voting Trust, which is controlled by five families including the Honderiches, as well as a majority of class B non-voting shares.

Through the trust's control of class A voting shares, the five families have been the guardians of a set of principles established for the Toronto Star by Joseph Atkinson, a former owner and publisher.

""The families have held control for more than 63 years and I'm proud to say not one voting share has been sold in this period,"" Honderich said.

""The families' dedication to the company has been a constant. They are uniting in saying this outcome is in the best interests of the company.

Among other things, the NordStar bid includes a promise to uphold the Atkinson Principles, which are seen to represent a progressive or liberal perspective.

The Torstar board issued a statement Monday that NordStar's amended offer remained superior to the latest proposal from Canadian Modern Media Holdings Inc.

CMMH increased its proposed offer to 80 cents per share in cash on Monday but Torstar said NordStar's offer of 74 cents per share was superior because it could be completed more quickly.

NordStar's initial offer was worth $52 million or 63 cents per share when announced on May 27 but was increased after the rival group came forward with another proposal on July 10.

Honderich said in a statement issued Monday that CMMH's submission on Monday was ""disingenuous and made for the purpose of confusing shareholders and obfuscating its own missteps.""

He said in the statement that the Torstar board believes the NordStar transaction ""is in the best interests of Torstar and all its stakeholders, and looks forward to a successful completion.""

Under the NordStar plan, Torstar will delist its shares from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the publishing business will continue to be managed by its current executive team.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/torstar-nordstar-vote-1.5657525?cmp=rss,news,business,

25093,2020-07-21 13:10,U.S. accuses Chinese hackers of targeting COVID-19 research,"The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday accused two Chinese hackers of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars of trade secrets from companies around the world and more recently targeting firms developing a vaccine for the coronavirus.

The indictment, which officials expected to discuss at a news conference, said in recent months the hackers had researched vulnerabilities in the computer networks of companies publicly known for their work in developing vaccines and treatments.

The indictment includes charges of trade secret theft and wire fraud conspiracy against the hackers, who federal prosecutors say stole information not only for themselves, but also that they knew would be of interest and value to the Chinese government.

Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research <a href=""https://t.co/qFWk5BA8Zb"">https://t.co/qFWk5BA8Zb</a> <a href=""https://t.co/pUiaStKbqn"">pic.twitter.com/pUiaStKbqn</a> —@TheJusticeDept

The charges are believed to be the first accusing foreign hackers of targeting scientific innovation related to the coronavirus, though U.S. and Western intelligence agencies have warned for months about those efforts.

Last week, for instance, authorities in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. accused a hacking group with links to Russian intelligence with trying to target research on the disease.

""China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being 'on call' to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party's insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies' hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,"" Assistant Attorney John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, said in a statement.

There was no immediate indication from the indictment that the hackers had successfully obtained any COVID-19 research, despite efforts to snoop on the companies.

But prosecutors say the defendants in January conducted reconnaissance on the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be researching a potential vaccine and searched for vulnerabilities on the network of a Maryland firm less than a week after it said it was conducting similar scientific work.

The case was filed earlier this month in federal court in Washington state and was unsealed on Tuesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-chinese-hackers-coronavirus-1.5657424?cmp=rss,news,world,
25137,2020-07-21 12:58,Raptors' Nick Nurse surprises Mississauga music teacher with $25K for new instruments,"A Mississauga music teacher is excited for the new academic year after Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse's foundation donated $25,000 to her school to buy brand new instruments for her students.

""Oh, my goodness. This is giving me so much street cred with my kids,"" said Julia Jung, a teacher at St. Aloysius Gonzaga Secondary School.

""Like, now they made me cool,"" she laughed.

It all started when Jung arranged for her students to put together a cover of Years in the Making, a song by Hamilton rock band Arkells. That was just one of her many efforts to keep students engaged during the pandemic after schools closed.

Jung messaged the band's lead singer, Max Kerman, to tell him about the project. Kerman responded, shared the cover video on social media, and spoke with Jung and some of her students.

Last month, he surprised Jung, a huge Raptors fan, by inviting Nick Nurse to join them on a video call, where the head coach shared the news of the donation on behalf of the Nick Nurse Foundation and Entertainment One Music.

""Nick Nurse was so generous and I really would love to talk to him more about music education because he's such a strong supporter of it,"" Jung said.

Nurse, who plays guitar and has appeared on stage with Arkells, launched the foundation in March.

The charity's ""series of programs will support the academic development of children and young adults through a mentorship approach,"" the foundation's website says.

""These programs intend to encourage parental involvement, while exposing students to music, sports and literacy.""

Jung says keeping students engaged during the pandemic has been a priority. (CBC)

Jung explained that sharing of instruments was already an issue at the school even before the pandemic, but now with new coronavirus safety precautions in place, it's even more of a challenge. This donation will be a big help, she said.

""It won't give every student their own instrument, but it will definitely help to disperse them. And then we can find other ways to accommodate them,"" Jung said.

'I was over the moon'

Meantime, some of Jung's students, past and present, are applauding the donation.

""My God, I was over the moon, man,"" said Chris Martins, 19, who just graduated, but not before participating in the Arkells' cover video.

""This is like an incredible, incredible donation. With music programs across the country and across the world, like, every dollar counts.""

A big part of why Kerman was so impressed with Jung, according to an Instagram post, was her dedication to her students during the pandemic.

Chris Martins says music has played a pivotal role throughout his high school career. (CBC)

When schools shut down in March, Jung and her colleagues in the music department loaded up their vehicles with instruments and safely delivered them to students who had gone home without them.

Since then, Jung has focused on keeping students connected to their music through virtual meetings, recorded lessons, and putting together performances like the Arkells' cover song. Beyond that, even into the summer months, she's been checking in on her students regularly.

""We want to make sure that the kids are doing all right,"" she said.

""Also, when you're an elective course, where it's not mandatory for students to keep or to enrol in your course, keeping up this communication with them makes them know that they're valued.""

For Vyshali Somasekaran, 16, who will start Grade 12 in the fall, that care means the world.

Grade 12 student Vyshali Somasekaran says Jung treats her students like family. (CBC)

""Ms. Jung worked super hard to help all of us get better and just keep in touch and make us all feel loved,"" she said, noting that Jung treats her students like family.

In fact, both Somasekaran and Martins were a part of a group of students who performed at Jung's wedding in February.

""It felt like just a great way to pay her back for everything that she's done for us these past years,"" Somasekaran said.

""Not even in music but just, like, in school and life in general.""

For Martins, the music program has played a pivotal role in his life.

""I'm on the autism spectrum, and music has always been my link to my community, and high school has been no different,"" he said.

The new instruments have already been purchased through Long & McQuade in Mississauga. The company is just waiting for the right moment to safely deliver them to the school. And for Jung, that can't come soon enough.

""We're so excited. We can't wait. I just want to be there and see this grand delivery of gorgeous brand new equipment come,"" she said.

25086,2020-07-21 12:30,Chief says pressure on Higgs for inquiry into justice system won't let up,"George Ginnish, chief of Natoaganeg First Nation near Miramichi, says the push for an inquiry into systemic racism in the justice system and policing in New Brunswick will continue until Premier Blaine Higgs agrees to one.

Calls for an independent provincial inquiry have increased since police officers shot and killed Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi in separate incidents earlier this summer and the person charged after the hit-and run death of Brady Francis was found not guilty in April.

Ginnish was one of 200 lawyers and prominent people who signed an open letter this week, urging the Higgs government to call an inquiry

""We will do it daily if we have to,"" Ginnish said in an interview with Information Morning Fredericton the day after the letter was made public.

Ginnish's signature was joined by many influential voices on Indigenous and legal issues, which was something he said was important.

Chantel Moore, 26, and Rodney Levi, 48, were shot and killed by police in New Brunswick eight days apart. CBC has permission from Moore's family to use the photos included in this story. (CBC)

""For so many from the legal field to say 'Yes, this is necessary in New Brunswick now,' it really strengthens the call. It's absolutely necessary.""

Ginnish said the advocates of a provincial inquiry will be following up with the government, despite not being happy with the two meetings Higgs has already held with New Brunswick chiefs.

Higgs has said a federal inquiry would be more appropriate for the issues First Nations want addressed, but chiefs have said his stance reflects a lack of understanding of the system in New Brunswick and where the impact is felt.

Quebec's Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes is conducting the investigations into the two police shootings.

""It's the premier and this province that have to call this inquiry,"" Ginnish said. ""If we could do it ourselves, it would already be done.""

The open letter details the differences between the justice system in New Brunswick and the system in Nova Scotia, where, Ginnish said, an inquiry in 1989 into the wrongful murder conviction of Donald Marshall led to changes.

Letter compares discrepancies in justice system

The letter says there are 64 practising Indigenous lawyers in Nova Scotia, compared with six in New Brunswick. New Brunswick has had one Indigenous judge, Nova Scotia five.

The letter goes on to point out other contrasts in justice and policing between the two provinces and comes to the conclusion that something needs to be done.

""The problems in New Brunswick's justice system are too long-standing, widespread, and pervasive to be dealt with by Quebec's Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI) investigations into the police shootings of Rodney Levi and Chantel Moore, or any review of the prosecution for Mr. Francis' death,"" the letter says.

Ginnish said Higgs's idea, to take some actions recommended in earlier, federal inquiries, might be fine in the interim but a provincial inquiry is still needed. Apart from investigating systemic racism, an inquiry would raise public awareness, provide much-needed data and help communities and families heal from the recent tragedies.

""In order to fight poverty, inequality, despair, you really need to address the justice system,"" said Ginnish.

The letter says the inquiry is the only way to restore trust in the justice system.

""A true commitment to reconciliation in these circumstances demands a public inquiry into the treatment of Indigenous peoples in all aspects of the justice system in New Brunswick,"" he said.

""Only through an independent, impartial inquiry can New Brunswick begin to come to terms with the role of the justice system in perpetuating racism and discrimination, and begin to repair the damage done to Indigenous communities.""

Ginnish said the short-term political responses don't deal with the larger issues.

""We don't need another short term solution. We need an inquiry that will help and form a longer-term comprehensive solution.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-letter-push-inquiry-systemic-racism-policing-justice-1.5657046?cmp=rss,news,canada,new-brunswick
25084,2020-07-21 12:10,Toronto-based fashion chain Mendocino won't reopen its stores,"Toronto-based women's fashion chain Mendocino has announced it plans to restructure itself under bankruptcy laws, a move that will result in ""all or substantially all"" of its 28 stores in Canada staying closed for good.

Like many others, the chain shut down its physical stores in March, when the coronavirus pandemic started in Canada. It began a cautious process of reopening some of them in late June, when restrictions lifted.

But the company filed paperwork last week to suggest that it is scrapping those reopening plans and instead intends to turn itself into an online-only seller of women's clothing.

""As a result of challenges resulting from the pandemic, the company recently made the very difficult decision to discontinue all or substantially all of their store operations and to focus on an e-commerce model,"" the chain said.

In paperwork posted online by the insolvency trustee handling the restructuring, Mendocino reveals it owes $2.8 million to its main lender, TD Bank, and $5.7 million to various other unsecured creditors, including landlords, suppliers, and other payment processing companies.

Founded in 1987, Mendocino has a half-dozen stores under its eponymous brand name and two-dozen of the lower-priced M Boutique. According to trade publication Insolvency Insider which first reported the plans, the chain has 28 stores in the GTA.

It's the latest Canadian retailer to succumb to COVID-19, joining Aldo, Reitmans and DavidsTea in announcing restructuring plans in recent weeks that will result in the closure of all or almost all of their physical stores.

TeamTennis dismisses American Danielle Collins for COVID-19 breach

Swimming body steps up to help Olympians preparing for Tokyo

KHL team Avangard Omsk reports 20 positive cases

Citi Open tennis event scrapped in Washington D.C.

TeamTennis boots Danielle Collins after protocol breach

Danielle Collins has been kicked out of World TeamTennis for breaking the league's COVID-19 protocols.

Carlos Silva, WTT CEO, says Collins left The Greenbrier resort hosting all of the matches during the league's three-week season and went out of the state of West Virginia.

""The protocols have been put in place and communicated numerous times to protect the health and safety of our players, coaches and staff,"" Silva said.

Collins is a 26-year-old American who was a semifinalist at the 2019 Australian Open. She has been ranked as high as No. 23 and currently is No. 51.

She was playing for the Orlando Storm at WTT, which took all nine of its teams and put them at The Greenbrier, where the season began July 12 and ends Aug. 2.

The WTT is not affiliated with the WTA or ATP professional tours, which have been suspended since March because of the coronavirus pandemic and plan to resume next month.

Swimming body gives $6.5M US in aid for Olympians

Swimming governing body FINA is giving almost $6.5 million US to help athletes prepare for the postponed Tokyo Olympics.

FINA says it wants to help athletes who ""endure hardships related to their training and competitive opportunities due to the pandemic.""

The plan includes $4 million for at least 160 national federations to support athletes with expenses for training, competitions and living over the next year.

A further $2 million will support 100 scholarships for athletes who currently do not have Olympic qualifying standards to prepare at national or continental centres. FINA supports regional bases in Russia, Senegal, Thailand and the United States. Grants totalling $460,000 will go to continental swimming bodies to distribute.

Russian hockey team records 20 positive cases

A Russian team playing in the Kontinental Hockey League has withdrawn from a pre-season tournament after 20 people from the club tested positive for the coronavirus.

Avangard Omsk general manager Alexei Volkov says the positive tests come from players and members of team staff who were tested during training camp. Volkov adds that the people are in isolation and that most don't have obvious symptoms.

Avangard was scheduled to play in a pre-season tournament from Aug. 4-9 in Sochi.

The last KHL season was cut short midway through the playoffs when the coronavirus pandemic made international travel difficult. The league is aiming to start the new season on Sept. 2 and expects to finalize the calendar after a board meeting scheduled for next week.

Later Tuesday, storied Russian hockey club CSKA Moscow said seven players have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The club says the unnamed players tested positive Tuesday and that none of them are displaying symptoms.

CSKA says in a statement the team has been tested for the virus each day since returning from vacation.

Citi Open tennis event in Washington D.C. cancelled

The tournament that was supposed to mark the official return of men's professional tennis amid the coronavirus pandemic has been cancelled.

The Citi Open in Washington, scheduled to start with Aug. 13 qualifying, was called off Tuesday because of what tournament manager Mark Ein said are ""too many unresolved external issues, including various international travel restrictions as well as troubling health and safety trends.""

The men's and women's pro tours both have been suspended since March and are planning to return next month. The first event on the most recently announced calendar is a women's tournament in Palermo, Italy, starting Aug. 3.

With Washington's hard-court tournament now gone, the first chance for men to play sanctioned matches will be the Masters-level event usually played in Cincinnati that was moved to the site of the U.S. Open, starting Aug. 22.

That is to be followed by the U.S. Open, beginning Aug. 31.

Track meet in Berlin planning for 3,500 fans

The ISTAF track meet in Berlin has outlined plans to have up to 3,500 spectators in attendance on Sept. 13.

Organizers say they have developed a wide-ranging plan to ensure spectators stay healthy but haven't revealed specifics. They were hoping for up to 45,000 fans at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin before the pandemic.

Meet director Martin Seeber says he hopes it will be ""a first small step back to normality."" Pole vault world record holder Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis is headlining the event.

25078,2020-07-21 11:55,The bizarre story of how internet conspiracy theorists convinced themselves Wayfair is trafficking children,"The baseless conspiracy theory took off after an anonymous user posed a bizarre question in an internet chatroom: What if retail giant Wayfair is using pricey storage cabinets to traffic children?

Self-proclaimed internet sleuths quickly responded by matching up the names of Wayfair products to those of missing children, producing social media posts that have since overrun Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.

The result: A national human trafficking hotline suddenly began taking a number of calls about the imagined Wayfair scheme, stretching its resources. A woman said she posted a video of herself on Facebook to counter false claims that she was missing. One mother's pleas to Facebook and YouTube to remove a video of her young daughter that was being used to suggest she was a Wayfair victim went unanswered for days.

Wayfair was forced to respond to the accusations in a recent statement: ""There is, of course, no truth to these claims.""

Yet internet users continue to weave a complex web around Wayfair's furniture and decor, spun from falsehoods and conjecture. Social media influencers, fringe online communities and even political candidates have also now seized on the conspiracy theory as evidence of an even grander one, known as QAnon, that centers on the baseless belief that President Donald Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the ""deep state"" and a child sex trafficking ring.

""Conspiracy theorists always managed to spread their theories in the past, but the internet has made this much easier,"" said Kathryn Olmsted, a history professor who studies conspiracy theories at University of California, Davis. ""If you believe in one, you believe in another. You start collecting them.""

Mentions of Wayfair and ""trafficking"" have exploded on Facebook and Instagram over the past week. And on TikTok, the hashtags #Wayfairconspiracy and #WayfairGate together amassed nearly 4.5 million views even as several strands of the conspiracy theory have been debunked.

The rumours persist in some dark corners of the internet despite Wayfair issuing a statement denying the completely baseless allegations. (Jenny Kane/AP)

Some social media posts pointed to the high cost of the storage cabinets — which sell for about $13,000 each — as suspect. Wayfair, however, said the steel structures were priced correctly for industrial use. A pillow listed for $9,999 also fueled suspicion, but was an error, the company said.

Other posts shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter connected the name of one of Wayfair's cabinets, Samiyah, to an outdated missing person report for an Ohio girl named Samiyah Mumin, claiming it was proof that the company is trafficking young girls.

A woman who identified herself as Mumin filmed a Facebook video to set the record straight.

""Why am I mad? Because I'm not missing,"" she said. Mumin did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment. The Ohio Attorney General's Office confirmed Mumin was found after being reported missing for a four-day period in May 2019 and has not been reported missing since.

A Maryland boy who briefly went missing in April also was identified by internet conspiracy theorists as a possible Wayfair victim because his last name matched the name of a pillow. He was found in less than 24 hours, with no signs that he had been trafficked or kidnapped, according to the sheriff's office in St. Mary's County.

The burst of attention for the Wayfair claims also renewed interest in the QAnon conspiracy theory. In recent days, three conservative congressional candidates in Florida, Georgia, and California who have expressed support for QAnon have also pushed unfounded allegations about Wayfair on Twitter. Thousands of tweets promoted the QAnon hashtag with claims that Wayfair is trafficking. A network of popular QAnon Facebook groups shared a video with a mashup of claims about human trafficking, including the Wayfair conspiracy theory.

The term QAnon skyrocketed on Instagram and Facebook, receiving more interactions last week than any other week over the last year, according to data from CrowdTangle, which tracks more than 4 million public pages, profiles and accounts.

<a href=""https://twitter.com/Wayfair?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Wayfair</a> WTF!!??! You can’t tell me this isn’t child <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/sextrafficking?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#sextrafficking</a> in plain site... selling the same $500 cabinets over and over and for $15,000 ?!! 🤬🤬🤬With little girl names on it?? This is sex trafficking in 2020?!!? EXPLAIN!! 🤬🤯😡 <a href=""https://t.co/FOYUCzQisR"">pic.twitter.com/FOYUCzQisR</a> —@AugustaReneeW

The attention created by the Wayfair conspiracy theory has, in some cases, been damaging for the very people social media users say they're trying to help.

An increase in calls prompted by the conspiracy theory is straining the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which provides emergency help to victims. The line was already seeing a surge in requests for emergency shelter assistance because of the coronavirus, said Robert Beiser, of Polaris, a nonprofit organization that runs the hotline.

""There's a very real possibility that if there's a conspiracy theory that comes out on the internet and it generates thousands of signals into our hotline, that could get in the way for us providing timely service to survivors who are in crisis,"" Beiser said.

Meanwhile, a YouTube video of a young London girl sitting on a couch to audition for a Wayfair commercial was used by some pro-Trump YouTube accounts to claim that she was a victim in the alleged trafficking scheme.

The video was taken from the girl's mother's YouTube account and spread across the internet, said Carleen McCarthy, a senior agent for the talent agency Alphabet Agency, which represents the girl.

The agency and the girl's mother repeatedly flagged the videos to YouTube and Facebook, as they continued to rake in thousands of views online. YouTube removed the video after the AP inquired about it, although new versions remain on the site. Facebook said in a statement that it's reduced circulation of false claims around the Wayfair conspiracy theory.

One YouTube influencer — who posted a video, viewed 155,000 times, that accused Wayfair of trafficking children through their products — walked back the comments a few days later.

""I didn't really have all the facts for that video, I just kind of made it on impulse because I was so scared,"" said Jeremiah Willis in a later video. ""I personally have no knowledge, no evidence, nothing.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wayfair-online-conspiracy-theory-1.5657192?cmp=rss,news,business,

Toronto remained atop Group C with five points from three games, ahead of New England by virtue of having scored more goals. A D.C. United win over the Montreal Impact in the final group game Tuesday night would leave Toronto, New England and D.C. all on five points but TFC can finish no lower than second, based on tiebreakers.

The group runner-up faces the Philadelphia Union, second in Group A, on Saturday in the knockout round of 16. The group winner takes on one of the four-best third-place finishers on Sunday.

Toronto outshot New England 15-10 (5-2 in shots on target) and had 60.4 per cent possession.

Toronto forward Ayo Akinola, who came in the game with five goals at the tournament, had several chances to add to his total. The best came in the 79th minute when, after taking an Alejandro Pozuelo through ball, he outmuscled a defender only to see goalkeeper Matt Turner get a limb to the ball.

Jozy Altidore came off the bench in the 86th minute, his first action at the tournament, and had an immediate impact, finding Akinola racing towards the penalty box. The 20-year-old forward was taken down by DeJuan Jones but, after video review, it was ruled a free kick just outside the box and not a penalty.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/mls/mls-back-toronto-new-england-july21-1.5657265?cmp=rss,sports,soccer,mls

Following a backlash, the government announced last year it would create a needs-based program starting in 2021.

25077,2020-07-21 11:06,Russian mayor charged over Arctic fuel spill resigns,"The mayor of the Russian Arctic city of Norilsk, who was charged with negligence last month over a major fuel spill in the region, resigned on Monday, the RIA news agency reported.

State investigators opened a criminal case against Mayor Rinat Akhmetchin, after 21,000 tonnes of diesel leaked from a tank near Norilsk on May 29.

Russia said in June that it had charged Akhmetchin with criminal negligence over what investigators said was his bungled response to a major environmental disaster.

In a statement, the Investigative Committee, which handles probes into major crimes, said Akhmetchin had failed to co-ordinate and organize emergency measures to contain and control fallout from the spill.

The charges, which could see the mayor jailed for up to six months if found guilty, came a day after investigators arrested three managers at the power station involved in the spill. They were suspected of having continued to use an unsafe fuel storage tank that had needed repairs since 2018.

The fuel tank at the power plant lost pressure and released diesel into rivers and subsoil near the city of Norilsk, 2,900 kilometres northeast of Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin subsequently declared a state of emergency in the region.

Norilsk, a remote city of 180,000 people situated 300 kilometres inside the Arctic Circle, is built around Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer, and has a reputation for its pollution.

The damages including the cost for nearby water bodies were estimated at 147.05 billion rubles, $2.8 billion Cdn, and for subsoil, estimated at 738.62 million roubles, $14 million Cdn.

25081,2020-07-21 10:57,Hollywood's Natalie Portman leads star-studded group bringing NWSL expansion club to L.A.,"Actress Natalie Portman and venture capitalist Kara Nortman lead a group that will bring an expansion National Women's Soccer League team to the Los Angeles area in 2022.

The team, tentatively named Angel City, will bring the league to 11 teams. Louisville FC will join the nine current NWSL clubs next season.

Portman and Nortman are joined by gaming entrepreneur Julie Uhrman, the cornsortium's president in the majority-female group. Others involved include actors Eva Longoria, America Ferrera, Jennifer Garner and Uzo Aduba.

Tech entrepreneur and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, the husband of tennis star Serena Williams, is the lead investor through his firm Initialized Capital. Portman, Nortman and Uhrman all have a financial stake in the team.

""I think it's so important to have role models and and heroes that are women for kids — both boys and girls — to see. And, it's just such an incredible sport in that it really is a team sport,"" Portman said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""You see one woman's success and all the others are cheering her on because one woman's success is the whole team's success.""

Among the founding group are more than a dozen former players, including Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach and Julie Foudy, as well as other female business leaders.

Portman said she heard Wambach, a former U.S. national team forward, speak at a Time's Up event and started thinking about how female athletes are regarded in society. Then she and Nortman met Becca Roux, the executive director of the U.S. Women's National Team Players Association.

""We started going to games and we just got so into it. And it was just kind of a revolution to see my son and his friends, these little 8-year-old boys at the time, wanting to wear their Rapinoe jerseys. And Alex Morgan jerseys. I was like, 'Wow, this would be a different world.' It wasn't unusual to them at all,"" Portman said.

Youth sports non-profit group on board

There were hints that the group was coming together last year when Portman, Gardner, Longoria and other celebrities went to a national team exhibition game at LAFC's stadium before the World Cup.

The women also reached out to a local supporters group that has been campaigning to bring a team to Los Angeles. The plan is to bring on additional investors as the team takes shape.

""We knew that there would be a strong and passionate supporters group here to support this. And from there it was about, `How do we do this in the right way? How do we do this differently?""' Uhrman said.

The group is partnering with the LA84 Foundation, a non-profit formed after the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that promotes youth sports. Angel City also announced its formal support of the foundation's Play Equity Fund, aimed at helping kids in minority and underserved communities.

""We believe these players need to be playing on one of the best stages in the world. But we also know that we have the power and the platform and the voice to make a meaningful impact in our community,"" Uhrman said. ""And so it's important for us to do that from Day 1. In the same way that we are building to put 11 incredible players on the field from Day 1.""

The NWSL, which began play in 2013, was the first professional team sport to return to action in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, with the Challenge Cup tournament in Utah. The semifinals are set for Wednesday.

The official name of the Los Angeles club, and where it will play, are expected to be announced later this year.

""The growth trajectory of the NWSL is incredibly exciting, but we also need to be strategic and thoughtful about how fast we expand and the communities we partner with,"" NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird said in a statement Tuesday. ""We've long sought the right partner in L.A considering the NWSL fanbase that already exists in the region and the massive interest in women's soccer in general.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/natalie-portman-expansion-team-los-angeles-nwsl-1.5657244?cmp=rss,sports,soccer,
25067,2020-07-21 10:39,Disgraced Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to run again in November election,"Myanmar's leader, and fallen human rights icon, Aung San Suu Kyi will be a candidate in the country's general election in November, a spokesperson for her National League for Democracy (NLD) party said Tuesday.

NLD spokesperson Zaw Myint Maung announced after a meeting of the party's central executive committee that Suu Kyi and President Win Myint will run in the Nov. 8 polls.

Suu Kyi was barred from becoming president by a clause in the constitution that was enacted under a previous military government. The post of state counsellor was created by her party as a workaround, giving her executive powers. She also holds the position of foreign minister.

Suu Kyi led her party to a landslide victory in the last general election in 2015. The victory ended more than five decades of military rule and was the culmination of over 25 years of non-violent democracy activism by Suu Kyi that won her the Nobel Peace Prize.

However, her failure while in power to end military abuses of the Muslim Rohingya minority in the western state of Rakhine drew condemnation from many of her former admirers worldwide.

An estimated 740,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, and the Interntional Court of Justice in the Netherlands has accepted a case of genocide filed against Myanmar.

Military still holds considerable influence

Despite that, Suu Kyi remains by far the country's most popular politician. Prejudice against the Rohingya is still pervasive in Myanmar.

The continuing influence of the military under the constitution has limited her government's ability to enact major reforms. The constitution gives the armed forces one-quarter of the seats in the lower and upper houses of the national parliament, enabling them to veto any changes to the charter.

Tactical alliances that Suu Kyi's party forged for the 2015 election are unlikely to hold for this year's polls.

The failure of her government to reach a workable plan to give ethnic minority groups the autonomy they have long sought has estranged them politically, and they seem likely to seek to boost their own parties rather than ally with Suu Kyi's.

The election commission announced that more than 37 million people are eligible to vote and 97 parties will contest the polls. A total of 1,171 seats are at stake at the national, state and regional levels.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/myanmar-elections-aung-san-suu-kyi-1.5657131?cmp=rss,news,world,
25071,2020-07-21 10:31,Goalies' readiness might be a wild card in NHL's return,"During normal times Vancouver Canucks goaltender Jacob Markstrom would be heading into his first playoff experience riding the confidence of a just completed NHL regular season.

Of course, these times are far from normal.

Instead of spring cherry blossoms, Vancouver is experiencing July heat. Instead of planning trips to the beach, the Canucks are in the second week of a training camp, preparing for a trip to Edmonton for the NHL's Stanley Cup tournament.

When the Canucks open their best-of-five play-in series against the Minnesota Wild Aug. 2, Markstrom will have gone more than five months without playing an NHL game that matters.

""It's been a long break,"" Markstrom said recently. ""Coming back (it's) different circumstances than it usually would have been ... but at the same time we want to keep building on what we started during the season.""

Markstrom's play, especially in the abbreviated opening-round series, will determine whether the Canucks advance in the playoffs. Practices and scrimmages can help other players find their legs and sharpen their skills, but are they enough for a goaltender to find his game?

25072,2020-07-21 10:27,Giants manager Gabe Kapler leads kneeling protest during U.S. anthem,"San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler plans to use his position to speak out against racial injustice and provide a voice for those who aren't heard.

Kapler and several of his players knelt during the national anthem before their 6-2 exhibition victory against the hometown Oakland Athletics. Kapler shared his plans when he addressed the team earlier Monday, and he said everyone would be supported by the Giants no matter what they decided to do.

""I wanted them to know that I wasn't pleased with the way our country has handled police brutality and I told them I wanted to amplify their voices and I wanted to amplify the voice of the Black community and marginalized communities as well,"" Kapler said. ""So I told them that I wanted to use my platform to demonstrate my dissatisfaction with the way we've handled racism in our country.

""I wanted to demonstrate my dissatisfaction with our clear systemic racism in our country and I wanted them to know that they got to make their own decisions and we would respect and support those decisions. I wanted them to feel safe in speaking up.""

Right-fielder Jaylin Davis, who is African American, and first-base coach Antoan Richardson also took a knee as shortstop Brandon Crawford stood between them with a hand on each of their shoulders. Davis held his right hand over his heart, while Richardson, who is Black and from the Bahamas, clasped his hands in front of him.

Much discussion went into each person's choice, and Kapler said some of the Giants reached out to other organizations. Kapler said the Giants would continue to have such important discussions together as a team and ""make them a part of the fabric of our clubhouse.""

Angels reliever raises fist

""We've had a lot of conversations about the anthem over the course of the last 72 hours and when I say we, I mean our coaching staff and our players,"" Kapler said. ""We connected with small groups of players, we connected with players individually and had meaningful conversations about this topic.""

It was on the same field where former A's catcher Bruce Maxwell in 2017 became the first major leaguer to kneel for the anthem.

In San Diego, Angels reliever Keynan Middleton kneeled and raised his right fist during the national anthem before the team's 1-0 victory over the Padres.

Angels manager Joe Maddon said Middleton told him in advance he wanted to kneel, and the team was ""totally supportive"" of the decision.

""I'm very proud that he stood up for his beliefs tonight. I really am,"" Maddon said. ""It's not easy to do that, a young man like himself, being the only one out here doing that.""

Kapler, beginning his first season managing the Giants after two disappointing years guiding the Phillies, didn't say for certain how often he would kneel except that ""we're going to have 60 chances in the regular season to make the same decision that we made today, to either stand or kneel or do something different. Right now it's another opportunity tomorrow night.""

Giants coach Alyssa Nakken makes MLB history

Kapler has been outspoken about social injustice and racial issues and athletes' roles in helping spur positive change.

""They felt strong about the issue so they knelt,"" A's pitcher Mike Fiers said.

Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016 to protest racial inequality and police mistreatment of minorities. He was roundly criticized for years, but public sentiment has changed since George Floyd's death in May.

Floyd, a Black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying he couldn't breathe.

Also Monday, Alyssa Nakken — baseball's first woman on a major league staff — got a chance to coach first base for San Francisco.

25079,2020-07-21 10:20,"Ontario reports 203 new COVID-19 cases, most in 3 weeks","Ontario reported 203 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, the most on any single day in about three weeks.

In a series of tweets this morning, Health Minister Christine Elliott attributed the uptick to ""localized increases,"" namely in Peel, Ottawa and Windsor-Essex. The three regions each confirmed 57, 43 and 24 new cases, respectively.

Another 30 were also reported in Toronto.

Elliott noted that 57 per cent of today's newly confirmed infections of the novel coronavirus are in people 39 years old or younger.

""While one day of data, today's increase is concerning,"" Elliott wrote.

""Ontarians of all ages need to continue to adhere to public health guidelines: maintain only one social circle of 10 people, physically distance with anyone outside of it and wear a face covering when doing so is a challenge.""

Ontario has now seen a total of 37,942 cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak began in late January. Of those, about 88.6 per cent are resolved.

After several weeks of steady decline, the number of active cases in the province has risen this week, up to about 1,584 at present.

The jump in new daily cases comes one day after Premier Doug Ford announced that another seven public health units would be moving into Stage 3 of the province's reopening plan on Friday. That means by the end of the work week, only Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex will remain in Stage 2.

(CBC)

Ontario's official COVID-19 death toll grew by one in today's update, and now sits 2,753. A CBC News count based on data provided directly from public health units puts the real current toll at 2,785 as of yesterday evening.

Meanwhile, the province's network of labs processed nearly 23,000 tests for the novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours. Another 11,842 are in the queue waiting to be completed.

Ford is scheduled to hold his daily COVID-19 briefing beginning at 1 p.m. in Mississauga. Ford's office says he will be joined by Minister of Long-term Care Merrilee Fullerton and Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie. You can watch it live in this story.

Front-line hospital staff hold protest

Front-line hospital staff in Ontario are planning a five-minute in-hospital protest this morning to fight the proposed extension of the province's emergency orders.

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it does not want the province's emergency order extended in its current form because it suspends their collective bargaining agreement.

The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill two weeks ago that would allow it to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

The union says that without the CBA in place they have no workplace rights, including having the time and location of shifts changed without notice or vacations cancelled.

Union president Michael Hurley argues that while those measures were acceptable at the start of the pandemic the emergency is over in most of Ontario.

CUPE hospital workers staged workplace rallies across Ontario opposing aspects of Bill 195 on Friday.

The union's membership voted in favour of further political protest actions last night unless the bill is amended.

25066,2020-07-21 10:14,Ukraine police trying to defuse hostage situation on bus,"An armed man seized a long-distance bus and took people in it hostage in northwestern Ukraine on Tuesday, launching an hours-long standoff with police, Ukrainian authorities said.

About 10 people are currently being held hostage, Ukraine's Security Service said in a Facebook statement. Police earlier had put the number at 20. It was unclear how many people had been on board to start with, and whether any escaped.

Police sealed off the centre of Lutsk, a city 400 kilometres west of the capital Kyiv. The assailant is armed and carrying explosives, police said. They said he threw a hand grenade at officers that failed to explode and shot at them at least twice during the still-ongoing siege.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said negotiations with the man are currently underway. ""We're doing everything to free the hostages,"" Zelensky told reporters.

The man called the police himself at 9:25 a.m. local time after taking control of the bus and introduced himself as Maksim Plokhoy, Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko said on Facebook.

In a Telegram account reportedly belonging to him, Plokhoy apparently admitted to taking people on the bus hostage, said that ""the state has always been and always is the first terrorist,"" and demanded that top Ukrainian officials release statements on their social media pages calling themselves terrorists.

According to Gerashchenko, police have identified the man as Maksim Krivosh, a 44-year-old Ukrainian born in Russia. Krivosh had allegedly been convicted twice on a wide range of charges — robbery, fraud, illegal arms handling — and spent a total of 10 years behind bars.

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov travelled to Lutsk to supervise operations.

Ukrainian media reported that gunshots were regularly heard at the scene. It wasn't immediately clear whether anyone has been injured. According to reports, Krivosh tried to reach out to journalists through hostages and their phones, demanding that they spread the word about his demands and get more reporters to arrive to the scene.

25068,2020-07-21 9:55,Chevron to buy energy company Noble for $5B in first major takeover since COVID-19,"Chevron will take over Noble Energy for $5 billion in the first big deal announced since the coronavirus pandemic shook the energy sector.

Chevron has been shopping for assets since last year and with crude prices down more than 30 per cent this year, it jumped Monday with its all-stock offering for the independent Houston oil and gas driller.

Based on Chevron's closing price on Friday, Noble Energy shareholders will receive 0.1191 shares of Chevron for each Noble Energy share. But with the list price comes a lot of debt.

Energy companies had been taking on enormous debt even before the pandemic with energy prices have bouncing all over the place. Noble is no exception.

The total enterprise value of the deal is $13 billion US, with Chevron assuming Noble's debt.

Other big players, seeking to cut costs and load up on assets, will likely follow Chevron's lead, said Gianna Bern, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.

""This is the first wave of acquisitions,"" Bern said.

Last year, as it pursued potential buyout targets, Chevron lost out when Occidental Petroleum made a $38 billion US deal for one of them, Anadarko, even though Chevron is five times the size of Occidental.

While Occidental's valuable holdings in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico appeared to be a good match, Chevron said at the time that it favoured discipline over ""winning at any cost.""

It's found another match in Noble Energy.

The acquisition brings to Chevron low-cost, proven reserves in addition to cash-generating offshore assets in Israel, strengthening the company's position in the Mediterranean. Noble's portfolio will also add to Chevron's U.S. acreage in the Permian Basin and in Colorado's DJ Basin.

""Noble Energy's multi-asset, high-quality portfolio will enhance geographic diversity, increase capital flexibility, and improve our ability to generate strong cash flow,"" said Chevron Chairman and CEO Michael Wirth. ""These assets play to Chevron's operational strengths, and the transaction underscores our commitment to capital discipline.""

That discipline is mandatory for any company in the energy sector this year.

On Monday, energy services company Halliburton reported a quarterly loss of about $1.7 billion US, and that was better than industry analysts had expected. The 57 per cent plunge in revenue was not.

Energy demand has bounced back as economies reopen globally. U.S. crude prices that fell for first four months of the year are gaining ground, and have been positive since May. It appears prices may remain positive for July, but prices are seesawing and the longest positive streak this month has been two days.

Surging cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., the world's largest economy, now threaten to hamstring an industry already hit hard by layoffs.

Chesapeake Energy, a shale drilling pioneer that was once one of the largest natural gas producers in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection last month.

25049,2020-07-21 9:50,Retail sales bounced back 18% in May but are still 20% below where they were before COVID-19,"Canadian retailers bounced back from COVID-19 in a big way in May, with sales up almost $42 billion or 18.7 per cent from April's record low.

Statistics Canada reported Tuesday that sales in 10 of the 11 sub-sectors the data agency tracks were higher during the month, as large parts of the economy started to reopen after being completely shut in March and April due to the pandemic.

The only type of store that didn't see sales increase in May was grocery stores, because business was booming in that industry since the early days of the pandemic. Grocery store sales slipped two per cent from April's level. Every other type of store saw higher sales.

Sales of cars and car parts increased for the first time in three months, clocking in with a 66 per cent increase in sales during the month.

Other stores fared even better, such as clothing stores (up 92 per cent) sporting goods, hobby, books and music (up 101 per cent) and furniture and home furnishings (up 58.6 per cent). Sales at gas stations were also 17 per cent higher than in April.

Sales were also up in every province, despite much of Canada's most populous province remaining closed through a good part of the month.

Quebec, Manitoba and the Maritime provinces led the way with higher-than-average increases, while Ontario was the laggard at 14.2 per cent, likely because the province was slower to reopen than most others.

While May's surge was encouraging, it was not in fact as big as the 20 per cent bounceback that economists were expecting. Preliminary data suggests an even bigger rebound is in the pipeline for June, as figures indicate sales were up by another 24.5 per cent, Statistics Canada said.

""Retail sales are rebounding strongly boosted by pent-up demand and as government income support measures provide a lift to household spending,"" Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said. ""While it looks as though retail activity returned close to pre-COVID levels in June, expect the broader economy to experience a longer, more drawn out recovery as the pandemic continues to weigh on a number of sectors.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-retail-sales-may-covid-19-1.5657094?cmp=rss,news,business,
25052,2020-07-21 9:21,Sudan's Omar al-Bashir goes on trial for coup that preceded his 30-year dictatorship,"Sudan's ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir was back in court on Tuesday, this time facing charges of plotting the 1989 Islamist-backed coup that removed an elected government and brought him to power.

Dozens of people, mostly al-Bashir supporters, gathered outside the courthouse in the capital, Khartoum, amid tight security as the former president was brought from jail and the proceedings got underway. Al-Bashir appeared in court wearing a traditional white robe and turban.

Shortly after the proceedings opened, the trial was adjourned until Aug. 11 so that the defence lawyers could prepare their arguments, said attorney Mohammed al-Hassan, who is on al-Bashir's defence team.

The military overthrew al-Bashir in April 2019 amid massive public protests against his rule. Months after the overthrow, the army generals and a pro-democracy movement behind the protests set up a transitional government.

The 76-year-old al-Bashir has been jailed in Khartoum since his ouster, facing several separate trials related to his rule and the killing of protesters in the uprising that helped oust him. He is also wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide linked to the Darfur conflict in the 2000s.

Sudan's transitional authorities announced in February that they have agreed to hand over al-Bashir to the ICC to face justice, as part of a deal with rebels to surrender all those wanted in connection with the Darfur conflict. But since that announcement, there has been no follow-up action on his extradition.

In one of he cases he faces in Khartoum, al-Bashir was convicted last December of money laundering and corruption and sentenced to two years in a minimum security lockup.

Former VP, defence minister also charged

In Tuesday's case, prosecutors accuse al-Bashir of plotting the 1989 coup that ousted the elected government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.

Al-Bashir is on trial along with over two dozen top officials in his government, including former vice-president Ali Ossman Taha, and former defence minister Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein, who is also wanted by the ICC over the Darfur conflict.

Al-Hassan, the lawyer, said coups ""happen historically, from time to time,"" referencing the many upheavals since Sudan gained independence in 1956.

""We think that there is no case"" for something that is part of Sudan's history, he said.

The experimental vaccine, which has been licensed to AstraZeneca, produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, preserving hopes it could be in use by the end of 2020.

""The end-of-the-year target for getting vaccine rollout, it's a possibility but there's absolutely no certainty about that, because we need three things to happen,"" Sarah Gilbert told BBC Radio.

She said it needed to be shown to work in late-stage trials, large quantities needed to be manufactured and regulators had to agree quickly to license it for emergency use before large numbers of people could be vaccinated.

Split opinions

England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and his deputy, Jonathan Van-Tam, took differing views on the potential timeline.

""The chances of us getting a vaccine before Christmas that actually is highly effective are, in my view, very low,"" Whitty told lawmakers.

Van-Tam, however, said he was ""cautiously optimistic that we will have some vaccine this side of Christmas.""

The Oxford scientists had eyed a million doses of the potential vaccine to be produced by September.

Although the deal with AstraZeneca has provided manufacturing capacity to do that, the lower prevalence of the novel coronavirus in Britain has complicated the process of proving its efficacy.

Late-stage trials crucial for providing data are underway in Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the United States.

25046,2020-07-21 8:39,U.K. officials 'avoided' looking into allegations of Russian meddling in Brexit referendum: report,"A long-awaited report published Tuesday on Russian influence in British politics criticized the British government for its slow response to allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

The report's authors say it was ""astonishing"" that no one sought to protect that democratic process.

They also accused the British government of ""actively avoiding"" looking into evidence of the Russian threat in the EU referendum. ""Serious questions needed to be asked,"" the authors said.

While the report from the Parliament's intelligence and security committee said it would be ""difficult — if not impossible — to prove"" allegations that Russia sought to influence the referendum, it was clear that the government ""was slow to recognize the existence of the threat"" even after evidence emerged of Russian interference in the U.S. elections and the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.

""As a result, the government did not take action to protect the U.K.'s process in 2016,"" the report said.

The report said Russia sees Britain as one of its top intelligence targets in the West. It said Russian influence in the U.K. is the ""new normal,"" and successive governments have welcomed Russian oligarchs with open arms.

Russia denies meddling

Russians with ""very close links"" to President Vladimir Putin were ""well integrated into the U.K. business, political and social scene — in 'Londongrad' in particular,"" the report said.

Speaking before the report was released, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russia ""never interfered in electoral processes in any country in the world.""

""Not in the United States, not in Britain, not in any other country. We don't do that ourselves and we don't tolerate when other countries try to interfere with our political affairs,"" Peskov said.

Authors cite delay in making report public

The report's authors said they were subjected to an unprecedented delay in making the document public, with officials holding off its release for more than six months. Critics claimed that was meant to shield Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party from embarrassment.

The report was originally submitted to Johnson on Oct. 17. The government initially said it couldn't be published until it was reviewed for national security issues, which postponed its release until after the Dec. 12 general election.

Further holdups were caused by delays in appointing new members to the intelligence and security committee.

Finally, Johnson named five Conservative lawmakers to the nine-person panel in hopes his hand-picked candidate would be chosen as chairman and block the report. The gambit failed when a renegade Conservative was chosen to head the committee with backing from opposition parties.

The opposition Labour Party has accused the government of failing to publish the report because it would lead to further questions about links between Russia and the pro-Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership, which Johnson helped lead.

Another parliamentary panel — the digital, culture, media and sport committee — previously published the results of its own inquiry into disinformation and ""fake news,"" which called on election regulators and law enforcement to investigate reports that a British businessman with links to Russia donated 8.4 million pounds (approximately $14.3 million Cdn) to the Brexit campaign. The National Crime Agency said in September that it found no evidence of criminal offences related to the donation.

The intelligence committee report covers the full range of the Russian threat to the U.K., including election interference, espionage and targeted assassinations such as the attempt to kill former spy Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury two years ago, said Dominic Grieve, who chaired the panel until he left the House of Commons after the election.

The government's explanations for delaying the report ""are simply not credible,"" Grieve said in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 News.

25050,2020-07-21 8:29,Recently active volcanic structures found on Venus,"Scientists have identified 37 volcanic structures on Venus that appear to be recently active — and probably still are — painting the picture of a geologically dynamic planet and not a dormant world, as was previously thought.

The research focused on ring-like structures called coronae, caused by an upwelling of hot rock from deep within the planet's interior, and provided compelling evidence of widespread recent tectonic and magma activity on Venus's surface, researchers said on Monday.

Many scientists had long thought that Venus, lacking the plate tectonics that gradually reshape Earth's surface, had essentially been dormant geologically for the past half-billion years.

""Our work shows that some of that interior heat is still able to reach the surface even today. Venus is clearly not so geologically dead or dormant as previously thought,"" said Earth and planetary scientist Anna Gülcher of the Institute of Geophysics in Zurich, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

The researchers determined the type of geological features that could exist only in a recently active corona — a telltale trench surrounding the structure. Then they scoured radar images of Venus from NASA's Magellan spacecraft in the 1990s to find coronae that fit the bill.

Of 133 coronae examined, 37 appear to have been active in the past two to three million years, a blink of an eye in geological time.

""In my opinion, many of these structures are indeed active today,"" said University of Maryland geophysicist and study co-author Laurent Montesi.

Coronae are essentially fields of lava flows and major faults spanning a large circular area. Many of the 37 reside within a gigantic ring in the planet's southern hemisphere, including a colossal corona called Artemis 2,100 kilometres in diameter.

25069,2020-07-21 7:59,Experts increasingly nervous as Alberta COVID-19 cases climb,"Alberta is seeing the highest daily increases in active COVID-19 cases since April, putting infectious disease experts, doctors and politicians on edge.

Over the weekend, new cases jumped by 368, bringing the province to a total of 1,100 active cases.

Thirteen regions in the province are also now under a ""watch"" designation, which means the area has more than 50 active cases per 100,000 residents. The highest is Clear Hills County, at a rate of 366.9 per 100,000 people. That's a similar case rate to U.S. states like Washington, Oklahoma and Kentucky.

Craig Jenne, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary, said the weekend's numbers unfortunately confirm that steady increases over the past week aren't a blip.

And, he said that could mean there's a need to implement more restrictions.

""The more sick people there are, the more infected people there are, the more people that they in turn will infect if we don't bring in additional restrictions. So we need be able to start holding the virus numbers where they are, otherwise we may have to reevaluate some selective closures,"" he said.

The number of people in hospital has doubled over the past week, up to 86, with 17 people in intensive care.

Calgary continues to be a hotspot, with 553 cases, up from 385 on Friday.

""We've doubled in one week, that's exponential growth. If we double again in one week and again in one week, that means two weeks from now, we will have more active cases in Calgary than we had at the height of the crisis in April. So this is bad. We certainly have more cases now than we did in March when we shut everything down,"" Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said Monday.

Calgary city council heard presentations from experts on Monday as it weighs whether to make masks mandatory on Calgary Transit. Council is expected to make a decision Tuesday, and could also potentially direct administration to look into drafting a policy or bylaw to make masks mandatory inside city properties or other public indoor spaces.

Dr. Raj Bhardwaj said if it were up to him, masks would be made compulsory immediately and that rule could be scaled back if the active case rate decreases, rather than waiting for circumstances to worsen before implementing that restriction.

25033,2020-07-21 7:16,Player's Own Voice podcast: Surya Bonaly's quiet revolution,"French figure skater Surya Bonaly's career truly is the stuff of legend.

She was the first woman ever to perform back flips in competition — the jump remains illegal to this day. Her gymnastic virtuosity set her apart from her contemporaries, as did her principled defiance at unfair judging. When she handed back her silver medal at the 1994 world championships, the gesture was compared to the raised fists in Mexico City in 1968.

Bonaly revolutionized her sport, yet never considered herself to be a rebel. She quietly did what she thought was right and let the figure skating world create its own uproar.

A classic Bonaly performance delighted fans and brought entire arenas to their feet.

As Player's Own Voice podcast host Anastasia Bucsis tells Bonaly, seeing her performances literally made the younger Bucsis decide to become an Olympian. And Bonaly continues to nurture new talent to this day, coaching elite skaters in her second home in the U.S.

25031,2020-07-21 7:09,U.S. President Trump to resume coronavirus briefings as cases continue to spike in some states,"The latest:

U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged a ""big flare-up"" of coronavirus cases, but divisions between the White House and Senate Republicans and differences with Democrats posed fresh challenges for a new federal aid package with the U.S. crisis worsening and emergency relief about to expire.

As the first round of U.S. federal coronavirus relief expires, the political stakes of providing more support to the American economy are high and rising ahead of the November election.

The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.

Congress has so far committed $3 trillion US to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last bill into law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to more than 3.7 million. The virus has killed more than 140,000 people in the United States. Both figures lead the world.

""We are nowhere near out of the woods,"" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

The number of cases was spiking in spots throughout the U.S., stressing the medical system, Americans' psyche and the economy.

WATCH | Border opening would likely lead to importing cases:

Malls in San Francisco were ordered closed about a month after reopening. Four months after the San Francisco Bay Area became the first place in the nation to issue broad stay-at-home orders to prevent the virus from spreading, only one Bay Area county is not on the governor's watch list for areas with rising infection and hospitalization rates.

In Chicago, the mayor imposed new restrictions on bars, gyms and personal services such as facials as health officials reported that the city again topped 200 daily cases on average. Officials attributed the rise primarily to young people going to bars and restaurants and Lake Michigan beaches.

In Florida, where nearly 9,500 people were hospitalized as of Monday, just 18 per cent of its ICU units were available.

Arizona said hospitalizations were at the lowest level in more than two weeks, while the number of people on ventilators and in intensive care also decreased.

WATCH | Phase 3 vaccine trials will track long-term health of patients:

Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University in the U.K. are seeing early signs of success in the first human trial for a COVID-19 vaccine. Phase 1 of the trial had more than 1,000 participants between the ages of 18 and 55. 8:42

In Texas, health officials in Houston were cautiously optimistic as the number of people requiring hospitalization ""seems to have tapered off a bit."" But deaths in the second-largest state soared above 4,000, and officials in the border area of Starr County, where a team of navy doctors was sent to help the only hospital, said they were considering creating an ethics committee to discuss rationing hospital resources.

""It sounds cold, and I hate to think that we would even have to do it, but we need to at least consider what chances a patient has of surviving,"" County Judge Eloy Vera said.

In California, which emerged as another coronavirus hot spot in July, Gov. Gavin Newsom said new infections, hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions were all still rising in the nation's most populous state but not nearly at the pace of recent weeks.

""We are seeing a reduction in the rate of growth but a rate of growth nonetheless,"" Newsom, a Democrat, said at a briefing in Sacramento.

""Hospitalizations and ICU [admissions] continue to be cause of concern in this state. That's why we want everybody to double down on what we've been doing,"" the governor said.

State governments not only face a strain on medical resources, but have been forced to borrow billions of dollars and slash costs by furloughing workers, delaying construction projects, cutting school aid and even closing highway rest areas.

After barely mentioning the pandemic in a nearly hour-long address on a variety of topics last week at the White House, the indications were that Trump would hold a coronavirus briefing late Tuesday afternoon.

""I think it's a great way to get information out to the public,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying he hopes to discuss progress on vaccines and therapeutics. Briefings were held on a nearly daily basis in March and April, including the weekends, but ended not long after the president's off-the-cuff suggestion that injecting toxic disinfectant could help treat the coronavirus.

Sporadic briefings led by Vice-President Mike Pence have taken place since, with government health experts such as infectious diseases specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Robert Redfield otherwise largely relegated to congressional committee appearances and select media interviews.

In a contentious interview that aired Sunday, Trump called Fauci ""a little bit of an alarmist"" when it comes to coronavirus messaging, and also received pushback from Fox News host Chris Wallace when making erroneous claims about the U.S. mortality rate.

What's happening with coronavirus in Canada

As of 7 a.m. ET on Tuesday, Canada had 111,126 coronavirus infections. Provinces and territories listed 97,474 of those as recovered or resolved, leaving 4,761 active cases. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,891.

In Ottawa, MPs returned to the House of Commons on Monday to debate legislation introduced by the Liberal government that would reform the federal wage subsidy and provide relief to people with disabilities.

WATCH | Young adults accounting for about a quarter of new cases:

The largest proportion of new COVID-19 cases in Canada have been people in their 20s for the last several weeks. Experts say a false sense of security and alcohol are likely factors in the spike. 1:59

The new bill, C-20, would expand the number of companies that qualify for the wage subsidy, change the amount companies can put toward their workers' wages and extend the program to the end of the year. The bill would send a one-time payment of $600 to people with disabilities and extend some legal deadlines for court cases.

The bill is likely to pass on Tuesday. While the Conservatives have taken issue with the complexity of its provisions, the Bloc Québécois has said its MPs will support the bill.

What's happening in the rest of the world

Financial markets pushed higher on Tuesday, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street after scientists at Oxford University said their experimental vaccine had prompted a protective immune response in hundreds of people in an early trial.

The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization hailed the results as ""good news,"" but warned ""there's a long way to go.""

""We now need to move into larger scale real-world trials,"" Dr. Michael Ryan told reporters in Geneva.

European markets are also likely to cheer EU leaders who, after four days of negotiations, clinched an unprecedented 1.8 trillion euro ($2.78 trillion Cdn) budget and coronavirus recovery fund to confront the biggest recession in the history of the region.

WATCH | Interferon appears to have some benefits, but more study is needed:

In the search for a treatment for COVID-19, interferon beta is showing promise. One company claims research shows it can lower a patient's risk of severe illness by 79 per cent. 2:03

A 750 billion euro ($1.16 trillion Cdn) coronavirus fund will finance loans and grants for countries hit hardest by the virus. That comes on top of the seven-year, 1 trillion euro EU budget.

""We have laid the financial foundations for the EU for the next seven years and came up with a response to this arguably biggest crisis of the European Union,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The pandemic has killed about 135,000 people in EU countries.

India added more than 37,000 new cases for a national total that now exceeds 1,155,000, the third most behind the U.S., with more than 3.8 million, and Brazil, with 2.1 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

India's new cases have hovered around 40,000 a day in recent days, with experts warning a series of peaks lie ahead as the virus spreads in rural areas where the health-care system is weak. The Indian Council for Medical Research, the top medical research body, was urging state governments to add more labs and improve testing capacity for the country of 1.4 billion people.

Lebanon's health minister said the financially troubled country, which had previously managed to contain the coronavirus, was sliding toward a critical stage with a new surge in infections, more than a fifth of them untraceable, after lockdown restrictions were lifted and the airport reopened.

""The danger of community spread is still possible because the country has opened up,"" Health Minister Hamad Hassan said in an interview with The Associated Press late Monday.

Mexico continues to register high levels of new coronavirus cases, as the Health Department reports 5,172 new infections, bringing the total to almost 350,000.

Daily deaths fell to 301, for a total of almost 39,500.

The continued high rate of transmission has caused some Mexican tourist areas to walk back previous reopenings and crack down on mask rules. The southern area of the Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo reimposed limits on hotel occupancy, and the Baja California resort of La Paz closed beaches again.

Worldwide, almost 610,000 people have died from COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins, with more than 14.7 million people infected.

25121,2020-07-21 7:00,Air Canada employee shocked to be laid off after 32 years because he is legally blind,"Sean Fitzgibbon is one of thousands of Air Canada employees who has lost his job since COVID-19 walloped the travel industry.

The Pointe-Saint-Charles resident had worked for the airline company for more than three decades, but in June he received a letter from Air Canada saying it could no longer accommodate his medical condition.

Fitzgibbon, who was a stock keeper, was declared legally blind about seven years ago.

""Most likely I was laid off because I can't do what an ordinary storeman can do,"" said Fitzgibbon.

According to Air Canada, stock-keeping is a multi-faceted job that involves shipping, receiving and warehousing of materials and parts. A stock keeper may, for example, retrieve a part from storage and deliver it to the hangar to be installed in a plane.

Despite having a visual impairment, Fitzgibbon was still able to do his job, with a magnifying glass at first, and as his condition worsened, he moved up to more advanced technology to help him see.

However, he was unable to drive trucks or operate machinery.

Despite those limitations, he thought his seniority would protect him when he heard Air Canada was beginning to lay off employees this spring due to the pandemic.

""I know business is a harsh world,"" said Fitzgibbon. ""But it seemed to me there were two lists: the normal list and the disability list. I was surprised no other accommodation could be made.""

Union says seniority should have been considered

Air Canada union spokesperson Serge Gélinas says Fitzgibbon has a lot of seniority and there are other jobs he could have done.

He said it is ""unbelievable and unreal"" that Fitzgibbon was let go after working for the company since 1988.

""Normally he should not have been laid off,"" said Gélinas. ""But because he is blind, Air Canada laid him off.""

Air Canada says it tried to accommodate

In a statement to CBC News, Air Canada spokesperson Pascale Déry said the company is unable to provide Fitzgibbon with a job that's suitable and that he can perform safely in a time when the workforce has been significantly reduced.

Déry says it even looked at jobs that aren't normally performed by members of his union, and she points out that the union was involved in the process from the beginning in Fitzgibbon's case.

Déry says a union executive even commended the way Air Canada handled Fitzgibbon's case.

""We understand his disappointment, but in the context of this massive downsizing affecting 20,000 people there is no other option at present,"" said Déry.

""As we also told him, should the situation change and a suitable role be found, we would be able to accommodate him.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/blind-air-canada-laid-off-stock-keeper-1.5656548?cmp=rss,news,canada,montreal
25026,2020-07-21 6:00,The CFL season on the bubble: Why Moe money and the Pallister pitch won't save Canadian football in 2020,"In a matter of months, COVID-19 has killed more than 600,000 people around the world, sickened another 14 million and brought the global economy to its knees.

The pandemic has reduced international travel to a trickle. It has forced major retail chains and bite-sized bistros into bankruptcy. It has transformed hugging and hand-shaking from benign forms of human contact into risky behaviour.

What the deadly virus can't seem to do, however, is eliminate a football rivalry between two smallish cities on the Canadian Prairies.

On Monday, the governments of Saskatchewan and Manitoba announced they've each made formal pitches for the Canadian Football League to play a truncated season in their respective capitals.

To make the case for Regina, Saskatchewan has offered Moe money. That is, Premier Scott Moe has pledged $3 million to the CFL for the privilege of hosting 60 games at Mosaic Stadium.

That's $500,000 more than Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister offered the CFL in a similar pitch for Winnipeg and IG Field. Nonetheless, the Manitoba capital boasts more hotel rooms and a more advantageous time zone, at least until the first Sunday of November, when static Saskatchewan catches up.

Both provinces boast a low prevalence of COVID-19. Both possess populations that care enough about the CFL to derive some sort of pride about serving as the hub for a series of games fans would not be able to watch in person.

The relative merits of Winnipeg and Regina, however, are entirely irrelevant if the CFL doesn't find some way to pay for pandemic-era pigskin.

Unlike larger professional sports leagues — namely the NHL, NBA, NFL and major-league baseball — Canadian football relies on ticket and concession sales for the bulk of its revenue, as opposed to broadcasting and sponsorship deals.

As Canadian Press football writer Dan Ralph reported on July 11, the CFL has asked the federal government for $42.5 million to stage some form of 2020 season. The league was hoping to land this money by this coming Thursday.

Without any federal or philanthropic help, it doesn't matter whether the gulf between Pallister's pitch and Moe's money is $500,000, five bunny hugs or a 500-millilitre jar of honey-dill sauce.

An abbreviated season isn't feasible without something to top up revenue from TSN and local radio broadcasters. And that may come as a relief to residents on both sides of the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border.

Roughly half the players in the Canadian Football League come from the United States, where the pandemic has been politicized and is raging out of control.

Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, who has spent the past few months identifying the importation of the virus as a major threat, said he is unconcerned about CFL players heading north from COVID-19 hotspots such as Florida and Texas.

""There's going to be a period of mandatory self-isolation,"" said Dr. Brent Roussin, adding quickly he is not yet certain whether that period will be the standard 14 days required for other international travellers.

""There's going to be mandatory testing that's taking place in there. And then again it's going to be all taking place in a bubble. So it's really a plan that takes in the consideration of the health of Manitobans.""

The bubble in question would encompass the hotels that would house CFL players, any CFL practice facilities and IG Field itself. It would also encompass any restaurants players visit, which would be required to close to other customers when CFL players are present, Roussin said.

As for the enforcement of the bubble, that would be up to the CFL.

""We're going to be holding them responsible for ensuring that the protocols are adhered to,"" Roussin said.

On one hand, this would not be all that different from the way Manitoba relies on the trucking industry, and to a far lesser extent the film industry, to police themselves during the pandemic.

On the other hand, professional athletes may not be as accustomed to the quarantine-like conditions that truckers and people who work on film sets routinely experience, even when there is no pandemic to fear.

How the CFL would police its bubble is uncertain. The league did not respond to a CBC News request for comment on Monday.

But again, this is an academic discussion without a means to pay for a 2020 CFL season. If no revenue source emerges by the end of this week, it may be safe to say the Canadian Football League bubble idea has burst.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-regina-cfl-hub-city-analysis-1.5656939?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba
25053,2020-07-21 6:00,Ancient Indigenous remains to be returned to Dokis First Nation,"For the past 10 years, work has been underway by people of the Dokis First Nation to have historical human remains returned to the community.

The remains were removed from Dead Island on Georgian Bay in 1891. It was something Chief Gerry Duquette Jr. hadn't heard about until his late-grandfather told him about it in 2011.



Duquette spoke with other people in the area to do more research and try to get more details. He says in the late 1800s, there was a major fire in Chicago. As a way to boost the economy, the city held an exhibition after the fire, which included displays or artifacts from all over the world.

""They were collecting all kinds of artifacts,"" he said.

It turns out the artifacts from Dead Island were moved to Chicago at the time to be a part of that exhibit.

""It was just this story that started to unravel that some of the elders had talked about it, but didn't actually know where they ended up,"" he said.

They eventually found out the remains were at the Field Museum in Chicago and Duquette says he reached out. He spoke with Helen Robbins, the repatriation director at the Field Museum. Her job is to connect with Indigenous communities to discuss what collections are at the museum.

Robbins worked with the community in researching to make sure the remains were from the area.

She says the museum has a policy in place to make sure the remains go back to the right area, and ensure there is support for the project to move forward.

""We need to return and not do a new wrong,"" she said. ""We don't want to be returning ancestral remains to groups that have no relationship to them. So it's a very difficult process.""

Robbins says the Dokis First Nation had no problem showing it had support for the project.

Eventually, Duquette and a few band councillors went to the museum to see the remains in person.

""We knew it was going to be emotional,"" he said. ""When we did get in the room and [the remains] were there, it was done very well, respectfully.""

He and the councillors held a smudging ceremony to pay their respects.

As for the remains themselves, Robbins says they are of six individuals.

""Mostly, they're female,"" she said. ""None of them are complete individuals. There are skulls … and in some cases, long bones.""

Helen Robbins is the repatriation director at the Field Museum in Chicago. (Submitted by Helen Robbins)

She doesn't know the exact age of the remains.

""Given their condition, I would say they had been there for several hundred years if not a couple of thousand,"" she said.

""I would say probably the youngest would have been a hundred years, prior to collection … but up to 3,000 years.""

Duquette says it's important for him to see the remains returned, especially since it was something his late-grandfather started.

""I might not be able to fill his shoes, but at least I'm trying to carry on what he started and to have that completed,"" he said. ""With the Field Museum, it's been so respectful.""

He says once the artifacts get back to the area, a ceremony will be held to ""bring those spirits back home.""

""I'm feeling very great and emotional in a good way,"" he said. ""It's something I can say is complete. We paid respect to these remains and they're coming home.""

He says the remains will be returned once travel restrictions are lifted due to the pandemic.

Robbins says this is the fifth international repatriation the museum has done.

""These kind of repatriations and righting past wrongs provide healing and strength to communities,"" she said. ""I don't want to project anything, but that's what I've been told.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/dokis-first-nation-repatriation-1.5656334?cmp=rss,news,canada,sudbury
25054,2020-07-21 6:00,"Gwich'in Tribal Council grand chief turns away from politics, toward family","Grand Chief Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan of the Gwich'in Tribal Council says she has decided not to seek re-election so she can spend more time with her family.

""It came down to the demand of my time, and although we say family is always first, there were times where I had to miss out on my daughter's school events and special occasions,"" she says.

The family came to the decision together last summer, says Greenland-Morgan.

Elected in 2016, Greenland-Morgan served one term as grand chief of the organization that protects and promotes the rights and interests of the Gwich'in people and their land. The election for a new grand chief and deputy grand chief is scheduled for Sept. 3.

The ""unnecessary drama and dysfunction"" of politics also influenced Greenland-Morgan's decision not to run again, she said.

""[There are] so many different views and values among the different people and different agendas,"" she says. ""It's crucial for leadership to focus on one agenda and that agenda should always be for the best interest and benefit of all Gwich'in (all four communities) and not just one over the other.""

Greenland-Morgan says she's pleased with what her team accomplished over the last four years.

For example, she says, there was the January release of the mineral development strategy in the Gwich'in Settlement Area — the first of its kind for the Gwich'in Tribal Council.

""Looking at the objectives of our land claim, and being environmental stewards, and being in support of responsible development, it's very important to have a strategy in place,"" she says.

Struggles for government contracts

But her term hasn't been without challenges.

Most notable, says Greenland-Morgan, are federal procurement policies that see work for projects within the Gwich'in Settlement Area put out to public tender.

""We strongly believe that when there's opportunities and projects within our Gwich'in Settlement Area, that those procurement processes need to change to honour that,"" she says. ""If we have the capacity and the capabilities to do work in our region, then we don't believe that we need to go to public tender.""

Neither Deputy Grand Chief Jordan Peterson nor Greenland-Morgan are seeking re-election. (Alex Brockman/CBC)

Grand Chief George Mackenzie of the Tłı̨chǫ Government voiced the same complaint last week after a contract for road work on Tłı̨chǫ land was put out for public bidding. He said the procurement process disrespected the Tłı̨chǫ land claim and self-government agreement.

The Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement was signed in 1992, so by now, says Greenland-Morgan, Gwich'in people should be seeing some of those direct benefits.

""That's the main reason why these [procurement] processes need to be overhauled, because in a lot of cases it's not working.""

The high turnover among members of her team has also been an obstacle, she says.

We strongly believe that when there's opportunities and projects within our Gwich'in Settlement Area, that those procurement processes need to change to honour that. - Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan, Gwich'in Tribal Council grand chief

To her successor, Greenland-Morgan urges putting the healing and well-being of people first.

""Like every other Indigenous group across this country, we have the intergenerational trauma of residential school and a lot of other things that have happened in the history of our country ... and there's a lot of healing needed yet,"" she says.

""The more progress we make with our people to revitalize who we come from, revitalize that power in the people, the more we heal as a nation — it's going to make things easier across the board. I really believe that.""

Urges voters to cast ballot

Born at the hospital in Inuvik and raised in Aklavik, N.W.T., Greenland-Morgan was previously an administrative assistant to the principal at the Moose Kerr School in Aklavik, a hamlet councillor, and executive assistant to former premier Floyd Roland.

""She was definitely dedicated to the people, even when she worked with me, she was always informed of the folks up there and what was happening,"" said Roland.

As for what's next, Greenland-Morgan says she hasn't made any commitments. For now, she'll spend more time with her family and her aging parents.

But before she does that, Greenland-Morgan is urging eligible voters to cast a ballot in the upcoming election.

""We do have a lot of solid candidates,"" she says. ""As you look at what they have to offer, it makes me hopeful.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/gwichin-tribal-grand-chief-not-seeking-reelection-1.5656805?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
25023,2020-07-21 4:48,"Lebanon nears critical stage in coronavirus cases, says health minister","Lebanon's health minister says the financially troubled Mediterranean country, which has so far managed to contain the coronavirus, is sliding toward a critical stage with a new surge in infections after lockdown restrictions were lifted and the airport reopened.

The recently recorded double and triple digits of new infections were coupled with an increase in untraceable cases, raising concerns that a dangerous spread in the community could follow, Minister of Health Hamad Hassan told The Associated Press.

Lebanon's early lockdown and strict measures to contain the virus were praised for slowing down the initial spread of the pandemic. Authorities have also aggressively tested, carried out random tests, and swiftly isolated infected areas.

But Lebanon's crippling economic and financial crisis has proven more difficult to manage. In late April, the authorities began gradually easing weeks-long restrictions that threw tens of thousands out of work; Lebanon's only airport reopened on July 1.

Today, the government doesn't appear ready to again tighten restrictions or impose another full lockdown.

So far, Lebanon has recorded more than 2,900 infections and 41 deaths, including one front-line doctor who died Monday at a hospital in the south, two weeks after contracting COVID-19. Hassan said the late diagnosis is to blame for the death of the 32-year-old physician. Some 150 medical staff have been infected, only a few of them becoming sick.

(Hassan Ammar/The Associated Press)

The reopening of the Beirut airport and the subsequent failure of Lebanese returning from abroad and their relatives to adhere to strict isolation measures caused a spike in infections, Hassan said. Many returning expats visited relatives and attended social gatherings, which helped spread the virus. New cases peaked last week with as high as 170 in one day, from an average of less than 20 a day in previous months.

""The danger of community spread is still possible because the country has opened up,"" Hassan said in the interview with the AP late Monday.

Despite a low death rate and low level of hospital bed occupancy, the minister warned that more than 20 per cent of the new infections are untraceable.

""When they are untraceable and I can't trace the clusters that I need to reach, then I start to worry that we are sliding into stage four,"" he said. ""We are still in the critical period between stage three to stage four.""

Stage four would necessitate return to more lockdown measures, though it's ""still too early"" to consider that option, he added.

In the beginning, people stayed home for months, helping contain the spread of virus, Hassan said. Now their needs to live must be considered — a dilemma facing all countries grappling with the slowdown of economic activities amid the virus.

Slide into financial crisis

Lebanon's crisis predates the virus, which has only accelerated poverty and unemployment rates, now at 45 per cent and over 30 per cent, respectively.

Before the coronavirus, Lebanon was already going through its worst economic and financial crisis. A highly indebted government bailed on paying its sovereign debt in March; banks imposed informal capital controls to prevent further drying up of liquidity and foreign currency. Nationwide protests demanded major reforms from a government that has failed to gain wide domestic or international support while talks for assistance from the International Monetary Fund stalled.

The crisis put a strain on resources and threatened fuel supplies, which raised alarm among the country's hospitals that rely on generators and fuel bought at black market rates. Private and public hospitals warned they may not be able to keep up with the surge in infections; private hospitals threatened to shut down, saying accumulated government debt, banking restrictions and a currency crash are making their operations unsustainable.

Hassan said he is counting on the government to continue to provide for hospitals, adding that a ""safety belt"" of financing until the end of the year is available to ensure that both private and public hospitals continue to operate.

But he also appealed on the health facilities to put up with the economic crunch Lebanon is facing. He said parliament has approved repaying a chunk of outstanding debts, but the currency crash is deepening the pressure.

""Today all these fears are legitimate. We are living from one day to another,"" he said.

25018,2020-07-21 4:00,"Paying volunteer students less than minimum wage was federal government's idea, says WE Charity","As the Commons finance committee prepares for more testimony on the controversial Canada Student Service Grant, WE Charity says one of the more contentious aspects of the program's design — paying students less than minimum wage for their hours of work — was the federal government's idea.

With only about six weeks left before their return to full-time studies, some students now say they want the federal government to scrap the stalled $900 million volunteer compensation scheme and redirect the funding toward financial assistance for post-secondary students and recent graduates.

CBC News asked WE Charity whether organizations that supervised volunteers could decide on their own to adjust how they counted their volunteers' hours if they were concerned about students not being paid fairly.

""The Government of Canada determined the compensation per hour of service for the CSSG, and WE Charity was contracted to administer CSSG according to that decision,"" WE Charity told CBC News.

The government's decision to partner with WE Charity to administer the grant has sparked controversy since the program launched on June 25. WE has close personal ties to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family and his role in selecting it is now the subject of a probe by Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion.

The program was set up in five tiers, with students qualifying for $1,000 in grant money for every block of 100 hours worked, up to a maximum of $5,000 for 500 hours.

That works out to a maximum hourly rate of $10 per hour — less than the minimum wage in any Canadian jurisdiction.

Legal experts have warned organizations that they could violate employment codes , like Ontario's Employment Standards Act, by taking on volunteers under the Canada Student Service Grant.

One potential host organization suggested to CBC News it was considering counting four hours of volunteering as six for the purpose of calculating the grant, in order to compensate students at a rate closer to $15 an hour.

'Red flags'

Senior bureaucrats appearing before the Commons finance committee last Thursday explained WE Charity's original agreement to administer the volunteer grant.

WE withdrew from its contract on July 3 , a decision Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's office called ""mutual.""

Gina Wilson, Chagger's senior associate deputy minister, said that in a partnership agreement like the one it had with the WE organization, the government sets performance measures and audits the results but ""does not direct or dictate how the recipient will carry out the project.""

""Contribution agreements lay out the funding and the broad policy objectives ... the desired results. Then it is for the third party to make decisions about how they achieve those results,"" Rachel Wernick, a senior assistant deputy minister at Employment and Social Development Canada, told the committee.

Nevertheless, WE Charity was not in charge of designing how the program would compensate students.

Things like the value of the grant, or how often students would be required to volunteer, were decided upon by the government, Chagger's office told CBC News Monday. WE's administrative role involved getting students to sign up and recruiting organizations to supervise them.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus asked Chagger during her committee testimony last week if her office sought a legal opinion about having students do work that pays less than the minimum wage — something he suggested should have raised ""red flags"" because it might not be legal and could leave charities liable.

""I'm confident that the public service would have done their due diligence and would have requested legal opinions,"" the minister said, after Angus accused her of throwing civil servants ""under the bus.""

""I think what's important to note is the difference between employment opportunities and volunteer opportunities. This was about service opportunities within communities,"" Chagger said.

Grant design was 'like Air Miles'

Angus later asked Wernick if her department sought a legal opinion.

""I need to clarify that this was a lump sum financial award like a bursary at the end of the summer. It was not an hourly wage and that was the nature of the grant,"" Wernick said.

""Rewards are like that. Like Air Miles, you have to reach certain levels before you get a reward,"" Wernick said later, adding she could not talk about the government's legal advice because it would ""constitute advice to ministers and solicitor-client privilege.""

Paula Speevak, the president and CEO of Volunteer Canada, told the committee that in late April she met with senior officials from Chagger's office and shared concerns expressed by her member organizations about ""paying an hourly rate for community service that is below minimum wage and calling this volunteering.""

""This could create the wrong message about volunteering and potentially undermine volunteer engagement in the future,"" said Speevak. ""There are also issues related to insurance — confusion about whether someone is covered as a volunteer or as an employee, and how that works.""

Because of its national network of volunteer centres and its expertise in volunteer engagement, Volunteer Canada was offered $100,000 to sub-contract as a ""strategic partner"" under WE Charity, Speevak said.

It declined.

Rollout 'bungled,' students prefer direct help

""I'm a big fan of volunteering, but this program really steps over the line of what we can consider volunteering,"" said Spencer Julien, a University of Toronto student. ""It's not volunteering when there's monetary compensation.

""It's unfortunate that the government thinks that the only way to incentivize young people to go out and help in their communities is by bribing them with this grant.""

Julien speaks for the #DontForgetStudents campaign. Since April, it's been asking the federal government to provide students with the same amount of emergency relief benefits it offers other workers affected by the pandemic: $2,000 a month, instead of the current $1,250.

Julien said more students would be willing to volunteer if they weren't so worried about how to pay for school — and paying them $10 an hour is ""an affront to workers and the progress workers have made.

""We could go and work at Loblaws for more than this would offer us.""

Julien's group is launching a petition Tuesday, joining the Canadian Federation of Students in calling for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit to be extended to international students and those who graduated in fall 2019.

Although the Canada Student Grant has been doubled for this fall, the federal government should also work with provinces and territories toward even more tuition relief, the groups say.

But students' most serious problems are less about tuition and more about the cost of living in the cities where they need to be for their studies, Julien said.

""The government has completely bungled the rollout of this program,"" Julien said, adding there's not enough time now for the public service to save it.

""The government has an opportunity to make up for what it should have done in the first place.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/student-aid-volunteer-we-charity-trudeau-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-1.5656622?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25019,2020-07-21 4:00,"Fatally Tasered by police in his own backyard, family of a young Black man speaks out","In the quiet darkness of an early morning last November, Clive Mensah stepped outside his Toronto-area home for the last time.

Before long, police cruisers descended on the area. Officers rushed into Mensah's backyard, taking him down with a stun gun.

About an hour later, the 30-year-old was dead.

What happened between the moment Mensah left his home and the moment he died is unclear.

For the last eight months, Stephen Boakye has been privately reliving the nightmare of his nephew's final moments.

He and his family have watched with a knowing horror as the stories of Black and Indigenous people and people of colour killed in encounters with police in Canada and the U.S. have made headlines.

""What happened in America, George Floyd… Look at that, it's the same thing. It's like Clive's memory came back and I was experiencing it,"" Boakye said.

All the while, his nephew's story has remained untold — until now.

On a recent sunny afternoon, just steps away from what was Mensah's home, Boakye broke his silence, along with another of Mensah's uncles, William Owusu — the only family members Mensah had in Canada.

Since Mensah's death on Nov. 20, 2019, his uncles say they've heard almost nothing from investigators, and are desperate for answers about why their nephew, a young, unarmed Black man with a history of mental illness, was fatally Tasered in his own backyard — and why no one, to date, has been held accountable.

Desperate for answers

Born in Scarborough in 1989, Mensah spent much of his childhood in Ghana. Described by his family as a gentle giant, he took his Christianity seriously and loved basketball as well as music.

At 18, he returned to Canada with his mother. Soon after, she moved back to the West African country. Mensah ended up living alone, but by all accounts he was faring well.

Tragedy would soon follow. In 2015, Mensah's father died in Ghana. The following year, his mother died, too.

""That had an effect on him,"" said Owusu.

It was around that time that Mensah's family believes his life began to unravel. In September 2015, he was charged in a robbery and pleaded guilty to theft and assault.

Mensah's parents, pictured here, died in fairly quick succession in 2015 and 2016. His family believes it is around this time that his life took a turn for the worse. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

A medical report from the same year indicates Mensah's mental state began deteriorating in mid-2014. He was taken to the hospital several times under the Mental Health Act, often unable to remember his own name and was ""frequently observed speaking loudly to himself.""

The psychiatrist's conclusion: Mensah was suffering from an ""unspecified psychotic disorder,"" possibly schizophrenia.

But on the surface, there were few signs of trouble. Mensah had found work, through part-time jobs at grocery stores. Most recently, he was driving a forklift at a warehouse.

""We knew nothing about his being ill mentally until I think he was taken to hospital for diagnosis, and then we found out. But when he was taking his medication, he was doing marvellously well,"" Owusu said.

Police called for noise complaint

Whether Mensah was suffering a mental health episode on the night of his death is unclear.

Here's what is known: Peel Regional Police were called to Runningbrook Drive in Mississauga around 3:15 a.m. on Nov. 20 for reports of a ""suspicious male causing a disturbance.""

One resident told CBC News at the time that shortly before police arrived, there was a commotion and yelling coming from a nearby parkette.

About an hour later, another resident called police after seeing ""a fellow running up and down the street, screaming and hollering.""

""I thought he was going to break in,"" resident Jim Tingley told CBC News at the time.

Mensah's family believes he was jogging the night of his death, singing to himself as he loved to do. But whether it was Mensah who Tingley saw is unclear.

Had it been that he was a white boy, singing on the road, jogging, would they kill him? - William Owusu

Ontario's police watchdog said officers found a man in a backyard in the area and ""a struggle ensued.""

""Several use-of-force options were used, including the deployment of a conducted energy weapon,"" said Special Investigations Unit spokesperson Monica Hudon.

Mensah was taken to hospital by paramedics, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 4 a.m.

Tased 6 times, paramedics delayed

Boakye was asleep at his home in Etobicoke when he was awoken by a phone call from the hospital, telling him to come quickly.

When he arrived, he says, a nurse and doctor took him to a room where Mensah was attached to tubes.

""It was then that they told me he's dead,"" Boakye said.

Hospital records from that night indicate Mensah was ""Tased approximately six times"" and was found by paramedics lying on the ground, handcuffed.

The report also notes a ""delay"" in reaching Mensah, adding ""police cruisers blocked roadway to scene,"" with paramedics having to park some 15 to 18 metres away.

As Mensah lay dead on the stretcher in front of him, Boakye recalls a nurse telling him, ""Your nephew was a big guy.""

""In my mind I was asking myself, 'Is it because he's a big guy you have to Tase him just like that?'"" Boakye said.

Since that night, just one of the three officers involved in Mensah's death has spoken with investigators, the SIU has told CBC News. The other two have so far refused.

Under Ontario's Police Services Act, ""officers cannot be legally compelled to present themselves for an interview with the SIU,"" the agency said in a statement through Hudon.

Growing anger over racism in policing

For now, the investigation into Mensah's death continues, with the SIU awaiting his post-mortem and toxicology reports.

Meanwhile, questions plague his family.

""Had it been that he was a white boy, singing on the road, jogging, would they kill him? Would they Tase him?"" asked Owusu, who believes racism directly contributed to his nephew's death.

Owusu has joined a growing chorus of voices demanding answers for what they say is a disturbing pattern of deaths at the hands of Peel Regional Police involving people of colour.

Peel Regional Police are currently facing questions over the role of racism in the deaths of D'Andre Campbell, left, and Ejaz Choudry, right. Both men suffered from mental illness and died in police encounters this year. (Claudius Campbell/Choudry family)

Asked about the possibility that racism played a role in Mensah's death or about racism in the force more generally, Peel Police spokesperson Heather Cannon said in a statement the investigation is ongoing, and once complete will undergo an ""administrative review.""

""We expect every one of our officers to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times,"" she said, adding members of the public with complaints about police interactions can submit them to the Office of the Independent Police Review Director.

If no charges are laid against any of the officers involved, Toronto lawyer Emily Lam intends to call on the coroner to consider systemic racism as a factor in Mensah's death, a move she believes is ""very rare.""

""Our client would like to understand the factors that resulted in their nephew Mr. Mensah's death,"" said Lam, who is representing the family.

""I think it's also important for the public to understand the shortcomings of a system and the factors that may have contributed to the deaths of other civilians… And to hopefully prevent these tragedies from happening again.""

Calls for coroner to consider racism in death

In a statement to CBC News, the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario said a coroner ""can only determine the cause and manner of death from a medical standpoint.""

If, however, through interviews the coroner believes racism played a role in a death, that information would be provided to police. Racism has previously been included in the scope of coroners' inquests, which can produce non-binding recommendations meant to prevent further deaths.

But the coroner's office conceded ""it is impossible to say when, how often, how long"" coroners have been reporting on race or racism.

Toronto lawyer Asha James believes that in the current context, an inquest probing prejudice in policing would be particularly valuable, especially given how often police have to deal with people experiencing a mental-health crisis.

""Systemic racism in policing in our society, and how that affects officers' perceptions and beliefs about individuals that they're interacting with, is definitely important in understanding things such as the ability to de-escalate situations,"" James said. ""Hopefully it's something that we can lead police services to try to start to change.""

Standing in front of the home where his nephew took his last breath, Boakye's mind travels back to the moment he came to collect Mensah's belongings.

""I feel very sad that he left us,"" he said. ""I hope we receive justice for what has happened to my nephew.""

""They have no right whatsoever to take his life,"" added Owusu. ""You are there to serve and protect. Not to serve and to kill.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/clive-mensah-black-taser-police-1.5655022?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
25020,2020-07-21 4:00,"Game on: To stem financial loses, the NHL and other pro sports leagues prepare to resume play amid COVID-19","With the NHL lurching back into competition, players and staff alike are trying to strike a delicate balance. Yes, it feels good to see players in competition. And it will give many fans something to cheer for during a difficult time. But above all, this was a financial decision. Just maybe not the kind you're thinking of.

""It's totally just trying to minimize loss,"" said Moshe Lander, a senior economics lecturer at Concordia University in Montreal.

He said professional sports leagues around the world aren't pushing to get back into action to make money. Rather, he said, they're doing everything possible to limit heavy losses.

He adds up the games played over the course of a normal NHL playoff run: eight first round series, four second round, two third round and then the Stanley Cup final. In all, fifteen series of best of seven games

""You're talking 75-90 games,"" said Lander. ""Each arena sits 15,000-20,000 people. You take 90 games of 20,000 people, that's 1.8 million (people) that pass through the gates.""

Teams are set to lose $150-200 million in ticket sales alone this postseason, even if play does resume as planned. And that doesn't even consider concessions or merchandise.

TV rights and sponsorship

The losses won't stop there.

""For the league, it's about the inventory,"" said former player and broadcaster Nick Kypreos.

Kypreos was one of the biggest names at Sportsnet when the network spent $12 billion dollars to buy the rights to broadcast NHL games in Canada. Now, he's host of The RealKyper at Noon streamed by the sports betting company Line Movement.

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has said the league will be resuming play 'for the good of our constituents and good of the game.' (Charles Krupa/Associated Press)

He said broadcasters paid big money to the NHL for content. That was all thrown into turmoil when the league shut down in March.

""That's a lot of games, a lot of advertising. A lot of sponsorship money,"" said Kypreos. ""If (NHL Commissioner) Gary Bettman and the league don't get those games back in, he's gonna owe SportsNet and NBC a lot.""

If the league doesn't deliver the promised content to broadcasters, there will be a debt to pay. It's unclear what that will look like or how much it will cost.

So the pressure to finish this season was clear. But Kypreos said this season will set off a series of dominoes that could swamp the teams, the league and the players.

""Guess who 50 per cent of the partner is; the players,"" he said of the way labour contracts between players and teams are organized. ""If those games don't get played, (the players are) on the hook for 50 per cent of the revenue.""

The NHL has officially announced it will return Aug. 1 with a 24-team playoff format in select host cities. (Justin K. Aller/Getty Images/file)

Spreading the financial pain

The NHL's collective bargaining agreement is a predictably complicated affair. What matters here is what the league calls ""escrow."" The teams and the players split hockey related revenue 50/50.

Over the year, players put money aside in an escrow account to make sure they have funds available to pay back the league if player salaries total more than club revenues.

If this season had collapsed and no games were played, some expected escrow to rise as high as 60 per cent — in other words, players would have had to kick back more than half of their salaries next year. The league's salary cap would also have taken an immediate, serious hit.

""Players aren't playing because they want to,"" said Kypreos. ""They're playing because they have to.""

So, the NHL and the players' association held a fevered series of meetings to hash out the reopening deal announced earlier this month. They agreed on a return to play protocol and extended the collective bargaining agreement for four more years.

""It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult and unprecedented situation,"" Gary Bettman told reporters after the deal was announced. ""And that to get through it, for the good of our constituents and good of the game, and for the good of our fans, we needed to work together.""

Experts say finding a way to share the burden was key.

""Let's stop the bleeding and let's share the bleeding,"" said Gord Stellick, former GM of the Toronto Maple Leafs and assistant GM with the New York Rangers. He's now a broadcaster and analyst with SportsNet.

He said the new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) saved everyone from much deeper losses than they would have experienced.

""It would have been chaos in many ways,"" he said.

Different leagues, similar problems

That potential for chaos is not unique to the NHL. Every major sports league is scrambling right now. Major League Baseball is still trying to salvage its own deal to return to play.

Both the NBA and Major League Soccer are readying to resume their seasons sequestered inside Walt Disney World as the case load soars around them in Florida. Star players in both leagues have tested positive for COVID-19 and two MLS teams have already been forced to withdraw from the tournament.

There are no guarantees that any of the leagues will actually pull this off; just trying is going to cost them a lot. Housing the teams and support staff will come with an enormous bill. Meals, medical tests and transportation will cost yet more. ESPN reported that the NBA's resumption plan alone will cost more than $150 million. The best case scenario from this situation: playing the least profitable season in modern professional sports history.

The reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors arrived at the Disney campus earlier this month after a two-hour drive from Naples, Fla., where the team has trained for roughly two weeks. The team's buses were wrapped with its logo and the words 'Black Lives Matter' displayed. (@Raptors/Twitter)

Stellick said the return to play is a clear financial decision, but that doesn't mean it's not also going to be a moment of symbolism and coming together during a rough time.

""I look at what sports can do,"" he said. ""Whether it's (then U.S. president) George W. Bush throwing out the first pitch (after 9/11), the Super Bowl after operation desert storm, Roberto Luongo in Florida after the Parkland shooting,"" he said sports can play an enormous role in bringing people together.

The last four months have been tough on everyone, Stellick said and there's still a lot of uncertainty. But he said getting players safely back to the ice can show everyone things can still work — things can still get done.

""Just the positive thing here, in the sunshine, let's try to make things work where we can.""

25021,2020-07-21 4:00,"MAID town hall: What the government, experts say about proposed changes to medical assistance in dying law","Whether you support it or are against it, one thing is for certain — medical assistance in dying, or MAID, is a complex, multilayered and deeply personal issue.

Canada's Parliament passed Bill C-14 in 2016, legalizing assisted dying. Since then, more than 13,000 people have chosen to end their lives that way.

However, a Quebec Superior Court decision struck down the ""reasonably foreseeable death"" clause in Bill C-14 as unconstitutional, forcing the government to amend the law earlier this year.

The amended law, known as Bill C-7, was tabled on Feb. 24. The proposed changes address, among other things, concerns around who is eligible for MAID, the role of palliative care, and the role of consent.

A full review was scheduled to begin this summer, but has been delayed due to COVID-19. The pandemic has also had an impact on the delivery of MAID across Canada as some hospitals temporarily restricted services, and personal protective gear (PPE) and physical distancing requirements added a layer of complexity to the procedures.

Canadians across the country still have many questions about who can access medical assistance in dying, and when. After the government tabled Bill C-7 in February, The National co-host Andrew Chang and members of the public put some of those questions and concerns to experts in a CBC town hall as part of an important yet difficult conversation. The expert panellists included:

David Lametti , Minister of Justice and the government's lead on the MAID file

The National Conversation on MAID was recorded on March 5, 2020, but due to the pandemic it was delayed and aired on The National on July 16 and on CBC News Network on July 19. These are some highlights from the town hall.

Phyllis Fehr is 60 years old, and a former intensive care nurse. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's seven years ago. While the diagnosis was difficult for her to accept initially, she does not let it stop her from living and ending her life her way.

Fehr asks: ""How will the medical system ensure that there are enough safety checks in place that I will indeed receive MAID when I am near death, and not too soon before I am ready?""

Madeline Li believes that advanced directives discussed and drawn up with family members, along with guidance from clinicians, can help ensure that patients' wishes as to the timing of MAID is clear:

Minister Lametti added that in addition to current safeguards already in Bill C-14, other safeguards are also under consideration.

""There will have to be safeguards that we look at when we do deal with dementia and Alzheimer's more specifically … we're always trying to find the right balance between safeguards and a person's ability to choose.""

Competency clause

Ron Posno has dementia and is a strong advocate of allowing advance directives for MAID. At present, the law requires a final consent just before MAID is administered — which is a worry for people with dementia, since they lose the ability to do that as their illness worsens.

Posno asks: ""Those of us with dementia have so far been left out of the conversation around MAID. Will people with dementia be included in the new amended MAID legislation?""

Minister Lametti says he believes that MAID and dementia is an issue of such complexity that comprehensive further review is needed before a decision of any kind can be made:

Trudo Lemmens adds that advanced directives for MAID by dementia patients is globally a hot-button issue. He points out that it is so complicated that, ""there is no country in the world except the Netherlands that allows an advanced request for medical aid in dying in the context of severe dementia.""

Power of attorney

Judy Kirby watched her mother die a slow, painful death. She had power of attorney over her mother's treatment, and although she could have stopped her being given water and oxygen, she says she did not have the legal ability to ask for MAID for her mother.

Kirby asks: ""Will or when will MAID be available to a power of attorney to make those decisions?""

Minister Lametti told Kirby that allowing a power of attorney to make decisions around MAID is an ""ethically charged issue,"" and that the government is going to look at it at a later stage:

Susan Desjardins, from Dying With Dignity, shared with Kirby that she had personally gone through a similar experience. She suggests the patient, ""identify not necessarily a power of attorney, but an advocate who could speak for them if they can't speak for themselves at a time at which they would meet certain conditions they had defined, [and] that at which time they would have wanted to have an assisted death.""

Expert assessment

Jason LeBlanc posed a question to the panelists on behalf of his girlfriend, Justine Noel, who was too sick to attend the town hall.

Justine is 29 years old and has fibromyalgia. She has submitted three MAID requests and has been denied twice. She's awaiting official assessment on her third request. LeBlanc says Noel is worried she will be denied access to MAID once again, due to a lack of medical expertise available to assess her specific condition.

Leblanc asks: ""Justine's question is, what do you intend to do when there is no available MAID assessor with expertise in the applicant's condition?""

According to Minister Lametti, the expert assessment for MAID no longer requires a specialist, but rather a practitioner with ""some level of expertise in the condition."" He adds:

Foreseeable death

Ernest Frederiksen is a 27-year-old who has lived in constant pain for more than 11 years, due to fibromyalgia and arthritis.

He applied for access to MAID in 2016 and was denied, as his death was not considered ""reasonably foreseeable."" He plans to apply again in a few months.

Frederiksen asks: "" Why should I, or those like me whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, have to continue enduring physical or psychological suffering that is intolerable and that cannot be relieved, through a 90-day waiting period instead of a waiting period of 30 days?""

Susan Desjardins from Dying with Dignity, also questions the rationale behind a 90-day waiting period before MAID can be given. ""Do we really need a 90 day period, or is some of your length of period [not] reasonable to achieve the goals that we're trying to here in terms of balancing things?""

Minister Lametti pointed out that there were waiting periods under the old act. However, in Bill C-7, waiting periods have been eliminated ""because we found that they don't work."" He adds that the 90 days is a ""period of assessment"":

Minister of Justice and Attorney General David Lametti explains why the 90-day period mandated by the government for MAID is one of assessment, and not a period of waiting. (The MAID town hall was recorded March 5, 2020.) 0:55

She's worried that once the requirement for ""foreseeable death"" is removed, MAID will be accessed by a disproportionate number of disabled and racialized people, as a result of a failure of the system to help them live full, sustained lives.

Jama asks: ""How are we going to make sure that marginalized communities like the Indigenous, racialized people, and those with disabilities, don't feel pressured to access MAID because they feel like a burden on the state?""

Trudeau Lemmons shares Jama's concerns. ""People with disabilities are now confronted with the choice when they enter the hospital. You can have MAID in 90 days, or you can go through administrative difficulties of applying for a new system of disability support ... that's actually not available.""

Minister Lametti admitted that the government needs to do more for marginalized people and communities. He stressed that the decision for MAID should never be one of compulsion, but rather always be an informed choice:

Moral dilemma

Bob Davies is a pastor at Kanata Baptist Church. As a person of faith, his biggest concern is the impact of MAID on those caregivers, organizations and people whose moral code does not permit it.

Davies asks: ""What is being done to protect organizations, health care workers, caregivers and others from facing the emotional and psychological consequences of participating in or being near a medically assisted death that is against their conscience?""

Minister Lametti assured Davies that no clause in Bill C-14 will compel anyone to participate in MAID if they choose not too:

MAID and mental health

Glenn Johnson has been living with PTSD and chronic depression for many years. He also suffers chronic pain from degenerative disc disease. He knows that he will want MAID when conditions for him worsen, and he wants MAID extended to those with mental health issues.

Johnson asks: ""Pain is pain. Suffering is suffering. And there is no foreseeable end to either my chronic pain or my mental health issues. I want to know why people like myself, with mental illness, are not able to access MAID?""

Trudo Lemmens admits that MAID and mental health illness is one of the most complex issues to tackle. Determining who will and will not get better is close to impossible, he says:

Minister Lametti added that, ""it is an ongoing challenge to better understand the various kinds of mental health issues that might become the basis for a MAID request down the road. We just kept hearing again and again that we weren't ready to make it part of the MAID package.""

Palliative care vs. MAID

Glenn Johnson. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

Dr. Naheed Dosani is a Toronto palliative care physician who works at hospitals and within the community to care for people with life-limiting disease at a variety of stages of illness.

In his view, priority needs to be given to better access and options around palliative care, rather than MAID.

Dr. Dosani asks: ""How are we working to build up our health care and social care systems, not just in hospitals but in the community too, so that all Canadians from all walks of life have equitable access to quality of life-based palliative care?""

Minister Lametti agreed that access to quality palliative care is crucial. ""As a government we have identified palliative care as critically important, and we're developing an action plan. We'll obviously work with our provincial partners and territorial partners to try to make sure that it happens.""

Susan Desjardins adds that she believes that both MAID and palliative care focus on the same thing — the quality of dying:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/town-hall-assisted-dying-maid-legislation-1.5491824?cmp=rss,news,health,
25022,2020-07-21 4:00,"Why Tenet's release date went TBA, and what it means for the summer movie season","For movie theatres trudging through 2020, there was one shining hope in the shrinking summer release schedule: Tenet.

The latest offering from director Christopher Nolan was poised to be the film that would welcome fans back to theatres. But with COVID-19 cases still on the rise in many parts of the United States, Warner Bros. announced Tenet would be delayed a third time, with a new date yet to be announced.

""Our goals throughout this process have been to ensure the highest odds of success for our films while also being ready to support our theatre partners with new content as soon as they could safely reopen,"" Warner Bros. chairman Toby Emmerich said in a statement.

And that could be bad news for Canadian film-goers, too.

A critical summer tentpole falls

Known for stunning special effects and wide-screen thrills, Nolan's films such as Inception and The Dark Knight have earned the adjective ""cinematic,"" and Tenet appears to be no different. With a budget reported to be over $200 million US, the film features John David Washington (son of Denzel), Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki in a time-warping global adventure.

WATCH | The trailer for the time-warping adventure film Tenet

For theatre chains, Tenet wasn't just another movie, it was the linchpin of what's left of the summer season, says Anne Thompson, editor-at-large at culture site Indiewire. Thompson says major theatre chains in the U.S. were planning on reopening on July 31. A big part of those plans was the expectation of Tenet's August 12 release date.

Indeed, shortly after Warner Bros. announced the delay, the head of the National Association of Theatre Owners responded. Speaking with Variety, John Fithian said distributors should ""release their movies and deal with this new normal."" Fithian said there's no guarantee more markets will be open later, and that films ""should be released in markets where it is safe and legal to release them.""

The Nolan factor

As far as what happens next, Warner Bros. said it is not treating Tenet ""like a traditional global day-and-date release.""

Translation: Tenet could open in other parts of the world before it opens in the U.S. But Jeff Bock, the senior box office analyst for entertainment research and data firm Exhibitor Relations Co., says a piecemeal strategy for Tenet may not work.

First, there's the issue of spoilers. Besides the stunning cinematography, Christopher Nolan's films are known for their shocking twists and turns. So Bock says a staggered release could be a problem.

""Once word gets out, it's on Wikipedia and it ruins it for everyone."" he said.

No reason for movie theaters to reopen without Tenet or Mulan... <a href=""https://t.co/pbKxYUjBL4"">https://t.co/pbKxYUjBL4</a> —@readDanwrite

As for Canadian films fans thinking they may see Tenet first, Bock says piracy fears could be another stumbling block. ""It's simply too risky to allow someone to capture the film on an HD camera — and Nolan wouldn't like that,"" said Bock.

Up until now much of what has been driving the Warner Bros. strategy has been staying on good terms with Nolan, a director who belongs to a rarefied club of of filmmakers. ""He delivers blockbusters — like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron,"" says Indiewire's Thompson. ""They have enormous power.""

Too big to stream

And like Spielberg and Cameron, Nolan is a big believer in the theatrical experience and would be disappointed to see Tenet consigned to a streaming service.

Whereas some smaller films such as the recent Tom Hanks film Greyhound have gone straight to streaming, Bock says Tenet is simply too expensive to recoup enough money on a streaming or video-on-demand service. The only way to earn back its massive budget plus an estimated $150 million for marketing (much of which is already spent) is in brick-and-mortar movie theatres.

On that front, Bock says there are signs of hope in countries where movie theatres have reopened. Over the weekend the South Korean zombie film Peninsula earned over $21 million US in Asian markets. Hollywood will be watching closely this weekend when the film Bloodshot opens in China.

In the meantime, North American theatre owners are nervously eyeing the movie release calendar with Mulan as the next major movie scheduled for August 21. Bock believes consumer demand to go see movies will return once its safe to do so. But Thompson says there could be fewer theatres in which to do so.

I have a solution: can’t Nolan find a wormhole and release TENET last summer? —@jessehawken

Tough times for movie chains

Thompson points out the American movie chains AMC and Cineworld are already both debt-ridden. As they take on more debt to survive, the chains will begin shedding the weaker theatre locations. Which leads Thompson to ask, ""How many more $200 million movies can the studios afford to make?""

While Warner Bros. says it will share a new Tenet date ""imminently,"" Bock says with the combination of a potential second wave of COVID-19 and the flu season in the fall, he doesn't see Tenet realistically being released before 2021. He says Warner Bros.' promise of a 2020 release date is ""the same carrot that's being dangled, they're just dangling it further away now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/tenet-delay-warner-bros-1.5656836?cmp=rss,news,entertainment,
25051,2020-07-21 4:00,Raptors' coach Nick Nurse surprises Toronto-area music teacher with $25K for new instruments,"A Mississauga music teacher is excited for the new academic year after Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse's foundation donated $25,000 to her school to buy brand new instruments for her students.

""Oh, my goodness. This is giving me so much street cred with my kids,"" said Julia Jung, a teacher at St. Aloysius Gonzaga Secondary School.

""Like, now they made me cool,"" she laughed.

It all started when Jung arranged for her students to put together a cover of Years in the Making, a song by Hamilton rock band Arkells. That was just one of her many efforts to keep students engaged during the pandemic after schools closed.

Jung messaged the band's lead singer, Max Kerman, to tell him about the project. Kerman responded, shared the cover video on social media, and spoke with Jung and some of her students.

Last month, he surprised Jung, a huge Raptors fan, by inviting Nick Nurse to join them on a video call, where the head coach shared the news of the donation on behalf of the Nick Nurse Foundation and Entertainment One Music.

""Nick Nurse was so generous and I really would love to talk to him more about music education because he's such a strong supporter of it,"" Jung said.

Nurse, who plays guitar and has appeared on stage with Arkells, launched the foundation in March.

The charity's ""series of programs will support the academic development of children and young adults through a mentorship approach,"" the foundation's website says.

""These programs intend to encourage parental involvement, while exposing students to music, sports and literacy.""

Jung says keeping students engaged during the pandemic has been a priority. (CBC)

Jung explained that sharing of instruments was already an issue at the school even before the pandemic, but now with new coronavirus safety precautions in place, it's even more of a challenge. This donation will be a big help, she said.

""It won't give every student their own instrument, but it will definitely help to disperse them. And then we can find other ways to accommodate them,"" Jung said.

'I was over the moon'

Meantime, some of Jung's students, past and present, are applauding the donation.

""My God, I was over the moon, man,"" said Chris Martins, 19, who just graduated, but not before participating in the Arkells' cover video.

""This is like an incredible, incredible donation. With music programs across the country and across the world, like, every dollar counts.""

A big part of why Kerman was so impressed with Jung, according to an Instagram post, was her dedication to her students during the pandemic.

Chris Martins says music has played a pivotal role throughout his high school career. (CBC)

When schools shut down in March, Jung and her colleagues in the music department loaded up their vehicles with instruments and safely delivered them to students who had gone home without them.

Since then, Jung has focused on keeping students connected to their music through virtual meetings, recorded lessons, and putting together performances like the Arkells' cover song. Beyond that, even into the summer months, she's been checking in on her students regularly.

""We want to make sure that the kids are doing all right,"" she said.

""Also, when you're an elective course, where it's not mandatory for students to keep or to enrol in your course, keeping up this communication with them makes them know that they're valued.""

For Vyshali Somasekaran, 16, who will start Grade 12 in the fall, that care means the world.

Grade 12 student Vyshali Somasekaran says Jung treats her students like family. (CBC)

""Ms. Jung worked super hard to help all of us get better and just keep in touch and make us all feel loved,"" she said, noting that Jung treats her students like family.

In fact, both Somasekaran and Martins were a part of a group of students who performed at Jung's wedding in February.

""It felt like just a great way to pay her back for everything that she's done for us these past years,"" Somasekaran said.

""Not even in music but just, like, in school and life in general.""

For Martins, the music program has played a pivotal role in his life.

""I'm on the autism spectrum, and music has always been my link to my community, and high school has been no different,"" he said.

The new instruments have already been purchased through Long & McQuade in Mississauga. The company is just waiting for the right moment to safely deliver them to the school. And for Jung, that can't come soon enough.

""We're so excited. We can't wait. I just want to be there and see this grand delivery of gorgeous brand new equipment come,"" she said.

She acknowledges it's still not clear what the fall will look like because of the coronavirus, but Jung hopes for a safe way for schools to reopen.

""I want to see them. I want to see them in person and I want to be able make music in person live.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/mississauga-music-teacher-gets-25k-new-instruments-1.5656584?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
25017,2020-07-21 2:11,"EU nations clinch 1.8T euro budget, coronavirus aid deal after 4 days","Weary but relieved, European Union leaders finally clinched a deal on an unprecedented 1.8 trillion euro ($2.8 trillion Cdn) budget and coronavirus recovery fund early Tuesday, somehow finding unity after four days and nights of fighting and wrangling over money and power in one of their longest summits ever.

With masks and hygienic gel everywhere at the summit, which was spread over five days, the 27 leaders were constantly reminded of the potent medical and economic threat the virus poses to their continent, and grudgingly committed to a massive aid package for those hit hardest by the pandemic.

To confront the biggest recession in its history, the EU will establish a 750 billion euro coronavirus fund, partly based on common borrowing, to be sent as loans and grants to the hardest-hit countries. That comes on top of the seven-year, 1 trillion euro EU budget that leaders had been haggling over for months even before the pandemic.

""This was a summit meeting where I believe the consequences will be historic,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron. ""It created the possibility of setting up loans together, of setting up a recovery fund in the spirit of solidarity.""

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, ""We have laid the financial foundations for the EU for the next seven years and came up with a response to this arguably biggest crisis of the European Union.""

With Macron and Merkel negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance struggled for days to get the quarrelling nations in line.

""The EU as a whole now has a big chance to come out stronger out of the crisis,"" said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""Tonight is a big step toward recovery.""

At first, the grants were to total 500 billion euros, but the so-called ""frugals"" — five wealthy northern nations led by the Netherlands — wanted a cut in such spending and strict economic reform conditions imposed, and the figure was brought down to 390 billion euros.

Tempers run high

The summit at the urn-shaped Europa Center laid bare how the nations' narrow self-interests trumped the obvious common good for all to stand together and face a common adversary.

Rarely had a summit been as ill-tempered as this one, and it was the longest since a five-day summit in Nice, France, in 2000, when safeguarding national interests in institutional reforms long was a stumbling block.

""There were extremely tense moments,"" said Macron.

Still, considering every EU leader had the right of veto on the whole package, the joint commitment to invest and spend such funds could be seen as a success.

The days and nights of brutal summiteering will surely have left many wounds between member states, but as history has proven, the EU has an uncanny gift to quickly produce scar tissue and move on.

""People have often accused Europe of being too little, too late. Here we demonstrated the opposite,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is an absolute record for a new budgetary instrument.""

Even if Tuesday's agreement was a giant leap forward, the European Parliament, which has called the moves of the member states too timid considering the challenge, still has to approve the deal.

One of bloc's longest summits

But Tuesday was a moment to revel in the achievement itself.

""An extraordinary situation demands extraordinary efforts,"" Merkel said as the leaders pushed on with one of the bloc's longest summits ever. What was planned as a two-day summit scheduled to end Saturday was forced into two extra days by deep ideological differences among the 27 leaders.

The coronavirus has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around 135,000 of its citizens and plunging its economy into an estimated contraction of 8.3 per cent this year. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez insisted the adoption of an ambitious plan was required, with the crisis continuing to threaten the continent.

The leaders mulled a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with 350 billion euros of grants and the same amount in loans. The five northern nations — the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark — had long opposed any grants at all, while the EU executive had proposed 500 billion euros.

The latest compromise proposal stands at 390 billion euros in grants.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and others also wanted a link to be made between the handout of EU funds and the rule of law — a connection aimed at Poland and Hungary, countries with right-wing populist governments that many in the EU think are sliding away from democratic rule.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/eu-budget-aid-package-1.5657000?cmp=rss,news,world,
25047,2020-07-21 1:08,B.C. warned of potential for 'explosive growth' as 102 new COVID-19 cases from over the weekend announced,"B.C. has seen a surge in new COVID-19 infections over the weekend, and officials are warning that the province is at a tipping point.

On Monday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry presented the latest numbers on the toll the novel coronavirus has taken in British Columbia, along with new modelling that offers a warning about the dangers of slipping up on measures to prevent transmission.

That includes a big spike in new infections over the weekend, with 102 new confirmed cases since Friday afternoon. There have now been 3,300 cases in B.C. since the beginning of the pandemic, of which 253 are still active.

The latest modelling suggests that the numbers of new cases reported daily are rising and could continue to rise over the summer.

""We do have the possibility of having explosive growth here in our outbreak, if we're not careful,"" Henry said.

WATCH: B.C.'s top doctor says we are experiencing a 'concerning upward bending of our curve' and are 'on the edge that might go up but is in our hands to control'

B.C.'s top doctor says an increase of over 100 cases of COVID-19 over the weekend is 'concerning' and should serve as a warning. 1:40

While B.C. has done a good job of flattening the curve of infection so far, she said the province is currently ""on the edge"" and could see that work undone in the coming weeks.

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix noted that while 102 new infections might not be large in comparison with numbers reported in other parts of North America, ""it is a lot more than we are comfortable with.""

He said that while there have been no deaths since Friday and the hospitalization rate has remained steady, deaths and hospitalizations tend to lag behind new infections.

Dix urged British Columbians to recommit to measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, particularly keeping groups small and meeting outside whenever possible.

Dix said the number of new cases should serve as ""a sobering reminder of how fleeting success can be.""

Sixteen people are now in hospital, including four in intensive care. There have been no new deaths recorded since Friday, leaving B.C.'s total at 189 to date.

60 cases now connected to Kelowna exposures

Henry said she's particularly concerned about the number of new cases that appear to have resulted from parties and larger public gatherings.

That includes 60 cases that have now been linked to multiple exposure events in Kelowna at downtown and waterfront bars and private gatherings around the Canada Day long weekend. Most new cases confirmed this weekend were people in their 20s and 30s, according to Henry.

""We are starting to see people who are testing positive in the last few days having a large number of contacts again,"" she said.

""We are no longer having safe interactions.""

Henry said that in the spring, most new COVID-19 patients only had close contact with three or four people, but public health officials are now having to trace 20 or 30 contacts for every person with a confirmed case of the disease.

The modelling presented Monday suggests that everyone needs to be cautious about how many other people they are interacting with — if the average person's number of contacts increases to 70 or 80 per cent of normal, the number of infections could rise dramatically.

Currently, the average person's contacts are at about 65 to 70 per cent of normal, which Henry described as concerning.

""We run the risk of a rapid rise,"" she said.

She said young people need to remember to keep groups small and focus as much as possible on spending time with family. When visiting restaurants, don't try to bend the rules by bringing groups larger than six people or by hopping between tables, Henry added.

Meanwhile, she said public health workers are looking into potential measures that could prevent transmission in situations like get-togethers in vacation home rentals or on houseboats.

Death rate high among patients in long-term care

New statistics presented Monday show that 20 per cent of COVID-19 patients in long-term care and 22 per cent in acute care units of hospitals have died of their illness. The death rate drops dramatically to 0.5 per cent in the remaining COVID-19 patients.

As British Columbians expand their social circles and more businesses open up in Phase 3 of the province's pandemic response, the modelling suggests that each new infection is generating an increasing number of additional infections.

In April and May, when the strictest measures were in place, each new COVID-19 patient infected less than one other person. That measure has now risen to more than one new infection from each patient.

Serology tests suggest that fewer than one in 100 people in B.C. have been infected to date, which means the vast majority are still susceptible to infection.

Mental health and financial burdens for young people

Henry and Dix also presented results from an online survey completed by 394,382 people about the impact of COVID-19.

The results suggest that most people have followed public health advice to wash hands regularly and avoid gatherings, but staying home when sick is still a bit of a sticking point. While 79 per cent of those who responded said they can stay home when they're feeling unwell, only about 67 per cent said they actually stay home.

The biggest problems caused by COVID-19, according to those who answered the survey, include loss of work, concern for vulnerable family members and mental health struggles.

Those between the ages of 18 and 29 were most likely to say their mental health and financial situation have suffered as a result of the pandemic.

Impromptu update

Monday's briefing is the first since Henry called an unplanned news conference Friday to announce 28 new cases of the virus, including a baby in neonatal intensive care at St. Paul's Hospital.

Henry said fewer than 10 people were exposed to the virus in the NICU, and the baby was not showing signs of illness. Health-care workers were also exposed, but she said she didn't know how many were involved.

The infants who were exposed at St. Paul's are isolating with their families, according to Henry.

Also on Friday, an alert was issued for potential exposure to COVID-19 at the Sandman hotel on Davie Street in Vancouver between July 7 and July 16.

Another case was discovered in a worker from Alberta at the Site C dam project and a list of potential exposures on flights coming and going from B.C. continues to expand.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-covid-update-july-20-1.5655625,news,canada,british-columbia
25080,2020-07-20 23:52,B.C. premier asks Trudeau to decriminalize drug possession as overdose deaths spike,"British Columbia's premier is urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to take an ""enormous step'' to reduce stigma associated with illicit drug use by decriminalizing possession for personal use.

In a letter sent Monday to the prime minister, John Horgan says people in B.C. are experiencing unprecedented rates of overdose-related harms, including deaths, because of the toxic street drug supply.

The letter says criminal prohibitions are ineffective in deterring drug use and criminalization prevents people from seeking the help they need.

Horgan says he supports the recent call by Canada's police chiefs to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of illicit drugs for personal use as the best way to battle addiction.

He says his ministers will reach out to their federal counterparts to take further steps.

The BC Coroners Service said last week that a record 175 people died in June of illicit-drug overdoses, surpassing the previous record of 171 deaths just a month before.

About 5,000 dead from overdose since 2016

A public health emergency was declared in 2016 and since then about 5,000 people in B.C. have died from illicit-drug overdoses, with many caused by the powerful opioid fentanyl.

""Behind these statistics lies a very personal tragedy,'' Horgan says. ""We are losing our family members and our friends, our neighbours and our colleagues. We must do more.''

Overdose continues to be the leading cause of unnatural death in B.C. and life expectancy at birth is declining in the province largely due to the overdose crisis, he says.

By changing the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to decriminalize possession for personal use, ""the federal government would take an enormous step to reduce the systemic stigma associated with illicit drug use and support people to access the services that they need to stay safe and start their path to recovery,'' Horgan says.

The federal Ministry of Health said in a statement Monday it has expanded the accessibility of vital health and social services for people who use drugs.

""These actions include supporting the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act, funding programs like drug treatment courts for those whose substance use contributes to their offending, supporting enhanced access to harm reduction services such as supervised consumption sites, access to pharmaceutical-grade medications, also known as safer supply, and an expanded range of treatment options,'' it said.

""Our government remains committed to advancing evidence-based responses to help reverse the trend of opioid overdose deaths and other substance-related harms in Canada.''

Canadian police chiefs call for decriminalization

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has proposed increasing access to health care, treatment and social services in order to divert people away from the criminal justice system, which would apply to those in possession of a small amount of illicit drugs for personal consumption.

It also called for the creation of a national task force to research drug policy reform that looked at the law that covers simple possession.

Association president and Vancouver Chief Const. Adam Palmer has said that the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply have devastated communities and taken thousands of lives across Canada.

""We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, health care and all levels of government.''

B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, has also called for the decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs, saying people use substances for many reasons.

Dionne Jocelyn Durocher, a 24-year-old woman from North Battleford and a member of the Canoe Lake Cree First Nation, was one of three people killed in a weekend tour bus rolled on the Columbia Icefield between Jasper and Banff, Alta.

A 28-year-old Edmonton woman and a 58-year-old Indian man also died. Twenty-four others were injured.

""The last thing I remember is falling onto the roof,"" Ernest said, guessing the bus rolled multiple times. ""I wasn't awake. When I woke up, I seen my girlfriend laying right beside me. She was barely breathing.""

Ernest and Durocher were visiting the area along with Ernest's cousin when the rollover happened on what was supposed to be the last day of their three-day trip. He spoke to CBC while still in hospital on Monday.

Ernest said it feels like his heart hurts. He isn't sure how he is going to back home and see Durocher's clothes and belongings but without Durocher there.

Durocher had been planning to go back to school and had expressed interest in social work in the past, Ernest said.

Now, he says he wants increased safety measures for buses like seatbelts. He believes Durocher would be alive had there been seatbelts in the tour bus.

""Put seatbelts on that God damned thing. Lives are more important than sightseeing,"" he said. ""I need something to change right away.""

In the aftermath of the crash, he searched for his cousin through the wreckage. Once he located his cousin and checked up on her, he ran back to his girlfriend. He noticed foam leaking from her nose.

""I knew she was about to die. She was looking at me,"" he said. ""I just laid there with her for the next half hour until paramedics came got me.""

Ernest said he was screaming Durocher's name the entire time, that it was going to be OK and help was on the way. He said when he saw the full extent of Durocher's injuries, he knew she wasn't going to make it through the incident.

""I felt f--ked up. I just kept telling her 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dionne. I love you. I'm sorry for bringing you here.' That's all I said,"" Ernest said.

The Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) program provides eligible students with up to $5,000 for volunteer work that they can put toward their education in the fall.

""Both Craig and I look forward to speaking about the work of WE Charity to assist with delivering the CSSG, under oath,"" said Marc who will appear with his brother at 1:00 p.m. ET on July 28.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government have been under fire since announcing the program and the contract with WE Charity late last month because of the charity's association with the Trudeau family.

Trudeau and his mother, Margaret, have appeared at a number of WE Day events, while Trudeau's wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, hosts a podcast for the group called ""WE Well-being.""

Payments to Trudeau family

Initially, WE Charity said members of the Trudeau family were not paid for appearing at WE events, although Grégoire Trudeau had been reimbursed for travel expenses.

Late last week, it emerged that Margaret Trudeau was paid approximately $250,000 for speaking at 28 events, while the PM's brother Alexandre spoke at eight events and received about $32,000.

The deal between WE Charity and the federal government has since been dissolved but the controversy over Trudeau's role in the contract continues to haunt his government.

Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth Bardish Chagger revealed to the committee last week that WE Charity stood to earn $43.53 million by administering the program.

Initially, the federal government said WE Charity would get $19.5 million, with $5 million of that going toward not-for-profits to help them with administration costs. The first payment to WE Charity was intended to create 20,000 volunteer placements.

Chagger said last week that an additional $10.5 million would have been made available to WE to help smaller not-for-profits participate in the program, and another $13.53 million would have been given to WE to create an additional 20,000 volunteer placements, if necessary.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/marc-craig-kielburgher-commons-committee-1.5656937?cmp=rss,news,politics,
25008,2020-07-20 21:31,"Inquiry into N.S. shooting necessary to dispel rumour, improve public policy: senators","Two senators who have added their names to a letter calling for a public inquiry into the mass shooting in Nova Scotia earlier this year say a full examination of the facts is required to dispel rumours about the attack and prevent it from happening again.

""It screams for a very public transparent process that examines all the issues surrounding violence against women, surrounding how someone could do this, why the police didn't notify as soon as possible that this was happening, why there wasn't at the very least an Amber Alert, why there wasn't a notice that this man was impersonating a police officer as soon as they knew,"" said Sen. Kim Pate told CBC News Network's Power & Politics Monday.

""All of those questions need to be answered, in large part, so that we can prevent these sorts of things from happening in the future for sure.""

Nova Scotia senators sent letters to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair and Nova Scotia Justice Minister Mark Furey on June 7 and again on June 29 to ask them to join forces for a public inquiry. Pate and Sen. Paula Simons signed the third letter, dated July 18.

Senators from across Canada have since joined the call to action by sending a third letter asking for an inquiry into the April shootings which left 22 people dead.

In addition to Blair and Furey, the third letter is also addressed to Minister of Justice and Attorney General David Lametti, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Development Maryam Monsef and Kelly Regan, Nova Scotia's minister responsible for the advisory council on the status of women.

""There have also been innuendoes in the media that the shooter in this instance may have been a confidential informant of the RCMP. There's not clear evidence of that but certainly articles in the Maclean's magazine have raised that possibility and there are real concerns,"" Simons told host Vassy Kapelos.

Informant rumours

The RCMP have been trying to quash speculation about the Maclean's story, which alleges the gunman was acting as a confidential informant or agent for the Mounties. The RCMP have repeatedly said they had no relationship with the gunman, and call the allegations ""very sensational and factually incorrect.""

""The longer it takes the more questions people ask and the more it looks like something's being hidden,"" said Pate. ""It strikes me that it would be in both government's best interests to get all of the details out as quickly and as transparently as possible.""

Simons said that aside from separating rumour from fact, an inquiry would allow politicians to craft public policy that might make a difference going forward.

""That's why we'd like to see an inquiry, not for the sake of the political theater, but for the sake of getting public policy answers so that we can try to prevent incidents like this in the future,"" she said.

25007,2020-07-20 21:11,"EU nations close in on 1.82T euro budget, coronavirus aid deal","Weary European Union leaders finally were closing in on an unprecedented 1.82 trillion euro ($2.82 trillion Cdn) budget and coronavirus recovery fund early Tuesday, somehow finding unity after four days and as many nights of wrangling over money and power in one of their longest summits ever.

To confront the biggest recession in its history, officials said the EU had as good as a consensus on a 750 billion euro coronavirus fund to be sent as loans and grants to the countries hit hardest by the virus. That comes on top of the seven-year 1 trillion euro EU budget.

""There were extremely tense moments. said French President Emmanuel Macron. ""But on content, things have moved forward.""

One EU official close to the talks said that ""we are as good as there.""

A diplomat from a big EU nation said the major issues had been dealt with, but that some member states were looking for final small concessions in the seven-year budget. A diplomat from another nation concurred, but said such issues could still take a few hours. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing.

Marathon talks started Friday

""An extraordinary situation demands extraordinary efforts,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the leaders pushed on with one of the bloc's longest summits ever. What was planned as a two-day summit scheduled to end Saturday was forced into two extra days by deep ideological differences among the 27 leaders.

Overall, spirits were high early Tuesday since the talks hit rock-bottom Sunday night.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, defending the cause of a group of five wealthy northern nations — the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark — was on the brink of securing limits to costs and imposing strict reform guarantees on any rescue plan for needy nations. It was the focal point of the marathon talks that started on Friday morning.

The coronavirus has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around 135,000 of its citizens and plunging its economy into an estimated contraction of 8.3 per cent this year. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez insisted the adoption of an ambitious plan was required as the health crisis continues to threaten the continent.

With Macron and Merkel negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance could not get the quarrelling nations in line for long.

The leaders mulled a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with 350 billion euros of grants and the same amount in loans. The five EU nations — nicknamed ""the frugals"" — had long opposed any grants at all, while the EU executive had proposed 500 billion euros.

The latest compromise proposal stands at 390 billion euros in grants.

All nations agree in principle they need to band together, but the five richer countries in the north want strict controls on spending, while struggling southern nations like Spain and Italy say those conditions should be kept to a minimum. The five have been pushing for labour market and pension reforms to be linked to EU handouts and a ""brake"" enabling EU nations to monitor and, if necessary, halt projects that are being paid for by the recovery fund.

Rutte and others also wanted a link to be made between the handout of EU funds and the rule of law — a connection aimed at Poland and Hungary, countries with right-wing populist governments that many in the EU think are sliding away from democratic rule.

25055,2020-07-20 20:09,Pioneering Yukon Indigenous leader in running to be face of the new $5 bill,"Rose Kushniruk says it wasn't easy putting in the nomination for pioneering Yukon First Nations leader Elijah Smith to be the new face of the Canadian $5 bill.

""It was a big challenge to describe him. They asked for 100 words or less,"" she recalled.

The Bank of Canada put out the call for nominations earlier this year. Nearly 45,000 submissions came in, and the list has been whittled down to 600 possible contenders — including the late Smith.

He was nominated by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. Kushniruk, the deputy chief, said a citizen came up with the idea in March.

""So they phoned me, and I got on it,"" she said.

""I think we, as all Yukoners, have somebody to be very proud of. And hopefully Elijah does make it on the $5 bill.""

Led historic trip to Ottawa

Smith was born in Champagne in 1912, and went on to become an outspoken advocate for First Nations rights in Yukon.

He was the founding president of the Yukon Native Brotherhood in the 1960s, and in 1973 he famously led a delegation of Yukon leaders to Ottawa to deliver a document called ""Together Today for Our Children Tomorrow"" to former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. It was to serve as a position paper on which to base future land claim negotiations.

That delegation made history by managing to convince the federal government to negotiate a modern-day treaty. That eventually led to the signing of Yukon's Umbrella Final Agreement — a watershed moment for Indigenous rights in Yukon and Canada.

""He was at the forefront of reconciliation in Canada,"" said Kushniruk.

""These agreements that we are living today are beneficial to everyone, both First Nations and non-First Nations people, especially here in the Yukon.""

The selection process for the new face of the $5 bill will take a while yet. An advisory council will begin by reviewing the 600 nominees — everybody from Samuel de Champlain to John Candy — and narrow it down to a shortlist. That will eventually go to the federal minister of finance for a final decision.

Then the process to design the new bill begins. According to the Bank of Canada, the new bills should begin circulating within a few years.

A similar process in 2016 ended with Viola Desmond being selected for the $10 bill.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/elijah-smith-five-dollar-bill-1.5656342?cmp=rss,news,canada,north

The Canucks confirmed the death on Monday. The Edmonton native was 68.

McIlhargey played 393 career games with the Canucks, Philadelphia Flyers and Hartford Whalers from 1974 to 1982 before becoming a coach.

McIlhargey returned to the Canucks as an assistant coach from 1985 to 1991 before spending the next eight years as head coach of Vancouver minor-league affiliates in Milwaukee, Hamilton and Syracuse, N.Y.

We are deeply saddened to lose our friend Jack McIlhargey.

After that run, McIlhargey went back to Vancouver as an assistant for four years and as an associate coach for two years.

McIlhargey finished his coaching career as an assistant for Philadelphia from 2007 to 2010.

In 1988, the Canucks sent McIlhargey to Russia along with goaltender Troy Gamble on an exchange program after they drafted Russians Igor Larionov and Vladimir Krutov in previous years.

Larionov and Krutov eventually agreed to play for Vancouver, part of the first wave of Russian talent to arrive in the NHL.

25000,2020-07-20 19:18,Saskatchewan government pledges $3M to CFL hub city bid,"The Saskatchewan government says it'll chip in $3 million in as part of a bid for the Canadian Football League's hub city — if there is a CFL season to be played.

""The Government of Saskatchewan is pleased to commit $3 million as part of the Saskatchewan Roughriders' bid to be the hub city for the 2020 season, provided the one-hub city model is approved by health officials and the Canadian Football League and Regina is selected as the hub city,"" a statement from Gene Makowsky, minister of parks, recreation and sport said.

Mosaic Stadium was to play host to the 2020 Grey Cup before it had been cancelled and postponed to 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Manitoba's provincial government had put forward its own $2.5 million bid for the hub city designation on Monday.

Regina Mayor Michael Fougere said the city made an in-kind donation worth about $1 million to allow the use of Mosaic Stadium for games and Leibel Field for practices, if the bid is successful.

""We want the sanction of the chief medical health officer and that's critical to make this work,"" Fougere said Monday afternoon.

Fougere added the bid is not a guarantee as city council would have to discuss the matter, and re-emphasized the event would need the OK from Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province's top doctor.

The mayor said Mosaic Stadium is the best stadium in the CFL and that he thinks Regina is the ""better"" city, though admitted bias clearly and plainly before making statements.

""[The bid] came together in short order and we should know in the next week or two as to what happens,"" the mayor said. ""I'm hoping that people will be happy to see this.""

In a statement, Arielle Zerr, the Roughriders director of communications, said the organization put the ""competitive"" bid together with the help of the province, the City of Regina and the Regina Hotel Association.

""We are proud of the package that we put together,"" the statement said, citing the economic benefit that could be had from hosting a condensed CFL season within Saskatchewan.

""We are excited about the opportunity of potentially being a hub city, but whether we win the bid or not we support the CFL and are hopeful that we can get back on the field and play football in 2020,"" the Riders' statement concluded.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-govt-pledges-3m-cfl-hub-1.5656799?cmp=rss,news,canada,saskatchewan

24997,2020-07-20 18:30,Active cases of COVID-19 in Alberta reach highest level since May 12,"Alberta now has more than 1,100 active cases of COVID-19, the highest number seen in the province since May 12.

The latest update from Alberta Health Services, released Monday, reported three more COVID-19 deaths, bringing the total in the province to 170.

The numbers have been climbing steadily in recent days. The province reported 165 new cases on Friday, 106 on Saturday and another 97 on Sunday.

That brought the total number of active cases to 1,109.

The three most recent deaths were: a man in his 90s, linked to the outbreak at Generations Calgary; a woman in her 90s, and a man in his 70s, both linked to an outbreak at the Misericordia hospital in Edmonton.

As of Monday, hospitals in Alberta were treating 86 people for the respiratory illness, with 17 of those patients in ICU beds.

Both of those numbers are up since Friday, when 68 people were in hospital, 13 of them in intensive care.

Most of the new cases reported over the past three days were in the Calgary zone. As of Monday's update, the regional breakdown of active cases was:

Calgary zone: 553, up from 385 on Friday.

Edmonton zone: 225, up from 213 on Friday.

South zone: 119, up from 99 on Friday.

Central zone: 131, up from 92 on Friday.

North zone: 76, up from 64 on Friday.

Unknown: five, down one since Friday.

Thirteen areas in the province were under watches:

Calgary-Centre

Calgary-Elbow

Calgary-Upper Northeast

Edmonton-Duggan

Cardston County

Clear Hills County

County of Stettler

Kneehill County

Mackenzie County

MD of Pincher Creek

MD of Willow Creek

Town of Drumheller

Wheatland County.

The ""watch"" designation means the area has more than 50 active cases per 100,000 residents.

The 368 new cases reported between Friday and Sunday followed 120 new cases on Thursday, which marked the first time since May 2 that the province reported more than 100 new cases.

Alberta has now reported more than 100 new cases on three of the last four days, with an average of 122 per day over that time period.

Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's chief medical officer of health, called Thursday's case number ""concerning"" and said she was worried that it might be a sign that Albertans were becoming complacent.

""I think this is a reflection of many people feeling that they are tired of the restrictions,"" Hinshaw said Thursday during her most recent news conference.

Alberta's top doctor is scheduled to hold another news conference on Tuesday. CBC News will carry it live.

24993,2020-07-20 18:22,St. Louis couple charged for pulling guns at protest,"St. Louis' top prosecutor on Monday charged a white husband and wife with felony unlawful use of a weapon for displaying guns during a racial injustice protest outside their mansion.

Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both personal injury lawyers in their 60s, also face a misdemeanour charge of fourth-degree assault.

Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner told The Associated Press that the McCloskeys' actions risked creating a violent situation during an otherwise nonviolent protest.

""It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner — that is unlawful in the city of St. Louis,"" Gardner said.

A lawyer for the couple, Joel Schwartz, in a statement called the decision to charge ""disheartening as I unequivocally believe no crime was committed.""

Supporters of the McCloskeys said they were legally defending their $1.15-million US home.

Gardner is recommending a diversion program such as community service rather than jail time if the McCloskeys are convicted. Typically, class E felonies could result in up to four years in prison.

Governor could issue a pardon

Several Republican leaders have condemned Gardner's investigation, including U.S. President Donald Trump, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and Sen. Josh Hawley, who has urged Attorney General William Barr to undertake a civil rights investigation of Gardner.

Parson said in a radio interview Friday that he would likely pardon the couple if they were charged and convicted.

Gardner said Trump, Parson and others are attacking her to distract from ""their failed approach to the COVID-19 pandemic"" and other issues.

St. Louis, like many cities across the country, has seen demonstrations in the weeks since George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, and the McCloskeys' home was initially incidental to the demonstration on June 28.

Several hundred people were marching to the home of Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson, a few blocks from the McCloskeys' home. Krewson had angered activists by reading on Facebook Live the names and addresses of some who had called for defunding police.

Conflicting stories over iron gate

The McCloskeys live on a private street called Portland Place. A police report said the couple heard a loud commotion and saw a large group of people break an iron gate marked with ""No Trespassing"" and ""Private Street"" signs.

A protest leader, the Rev. Darryl Gray, said the gate was open and that protesters didn't damage it.

Mark McCloskey confronted protesters with a semi-automatic rifle, screamed at them and pointed the weapon at them, according to a probable statement.

The statement said Patricia McCloskey then emerged with a semi-automatic handgun, yelling at protesters to ""go"" and pointing it at them. No shots were fired.

Photos of the couple emerged as memes on both sides of the gun debate.

Trump criticizes prosecutor's investigation

Trump spoke by phone with Parson last week to criticize Gardner's investigation.

Parson, when he was in the legislature, co-authored Missouri's ""castle doctrine"" law that justifies deadly force for those who are defending their homes from intruders. He has said that the McCloskeys ""had every right to protect their property.""

Gardner declined to discuss why she decided the castle doctrine didn't apply.

Schwartz said the McCloskeys ""support the First Amendment right of every citizen to have their voice and opinion heard. This right, however, must be balanced with the Second Amendment and Missouri law, which entitle each of us to protect our home and family from potential threats.""

Gardner, St. Louis' first Black circuit attorney, has been at odds with some in the St. Louis establishment since her election in 2016.

Most notably, her office charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy in 2018 for allegedly taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair. The charge was eventually dropped, but Greitens resigned in June 2018.

A private investigator Gardner hired to investigate the claims against Greitens was later indicted for perjury for allegedly lying during a deposition. His case is pending.

WATCH | Trump shares video of couple pointing guns at protesters:

U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted a news report featuring video of a St. Louis couple pointing a handgun and a rifle at demonstrators who were marching to the mayor's house. 1:28

Gardner also has butted heads with police leaders, especially after she developed an ""exclusion list"" of more than two dozen officers who were barred from serving as primary witnesses in criminal cases over what Gardner called credibility concerns. The move angered Police Chief John Hayden, who also is Black.

In January, Gardner filed a federal lawsuit accusing the city, the police union and others of a co-ordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit also accused ""entrenched interests"" of intentionally impeding her efforts to change racist practices.

Several Black leaders in St. Louis have expressed support for Gardner, including Democratic U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, who has said protesters ""should never be subject to the threat of deadly force, whether by individuals or by the police.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/st-louis-couple-guns-black-lives-matters-protesters-1.5656662?cmp=rss,news,world,

24992,2020-07-20 18:03,'Men's rights' lawyer being investigated in attack on U.S. federal judge's family,"A self-described ""anti-feminist"" lawyer found dead in the Catskills of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound is being investigated as the possible gunman in the shooting of a federal judge's family in New Jersey, two officials with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press.

Roy Den Hollander, who received media attention including appearances on Fox News and Comedy Central for lawsuits challenging perceived infringements of ""men's rights,"" was found dead Monday in Sullivan County, N.Y., the officials said.

A day earlier, a gunman posing as a FedEx delivery person went to the North Brunswick, N.J., home of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, and started shooting, wounding her husband, the defence lawyer Mark Anderl, and killing her son, Daniel Anderl.

Salas was at home but in another part of the house and was unharmed, said the officials, who could not discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Suspect had case before judge

Den Hollander had a gender-equity lawsuit, filed in 2015, that was being heard by Salas involving a young woman who wanted to register for the military draft.

He also mentioned the judge in writings posted online, deriding her as a ladder climber who traded on her Hispanic heritage to get ahead.

A package addressed to Salas was found along with Den Hollander's body, the officials said.

In a screed Den Hollander posted online, he also wrote of posing as a FedEx delivery person to speak with a young girl, the same tactic the gunman apparently used at the door to the judge's family home.

Den Hollander was best known in years past for unsuccessful lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of ""ladies night"" promotions at bars and nightclubs.

His litigation, and willingness to appear on television, earned him spots on The Colbert Report and MSNBC.

Son had just turned 20

Daniel Anderl, Salas's son, was set to be heading back shortly to the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he was named to the Dean's List this spring.

""I was shocked last night to hear news of Daniel Anderl's tragic death Sunday evening in New Jersey. Daniel was a rising junior, enrolled for classes beginning in the next few weeks,"" university president John Garvey wrote on Twitter. ""He turned 20 last week.""

Esther Salas, seated in Newark, was nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed in 2011. Prior to that, she served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in New Jersey, after working as an assistant public defender for several years.

Salas, born in California to a Cuban immigrant mother and Mexican father, spent most of her childhood in Union City, N.J.

After helping her family escape a devastating house fire, she acted as her mother's translator and advocate, foreshadowing her career in law as she argued her family's case to welfare officials, according to a 2018 magazine profile.

In the profile, Salas spoke of her son possibly following his parents into the legal profession.

""He's been arguing with us since he could talk — practising his advocacy skills,"" Salas told New Jersey Monthly. ""I don't want to dissuade him, but I was pulling for a doctor.""

Judge oversaw high-profile cases

Just last week, Salas was appointed to hear an ongoing lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank investors who claim the company made false and misleading statements about its anti-money laundering policies and failed to monitor ""high-risk"" customers including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Her highest-profile case in recent years was the financial fraud case involving husband-and-wife Real Housewives of New Jersey reality TV stars Teresa and Joe Giudice, whom Salas sentenced to prison for crimes including bankruptcy fraud and tax evasion. Salas staggered their sentences so that one of them could be available to take care of their four children.

In 2017, she barred federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against an alleged gang leader charged in several Newark slayings, ruling the man's intellectual disability made him ineligible for capital punishment. Salas later sentenced the man to 45 years in prison.

Attorney General William Barr said in a statement Monday that the FBI and the U.S. Marshals will continue investigating the shooting.

""This kind of lawless, evil action carried out against a member of the federal judiciary will not be tolerated,"" he said in the statement.

Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, who backed Salas's nomination to the federal bench, said in a statement Sunday night that he hoped ""those responsible for this horrendous act are swiftly apprehended and brought to justice.""

In an emailed statement, Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy called the shooting ""a senseless act"" and said ""this tragedy is our latest reminder that gun violence remains a crisis in our country and that our work to make every community safer isn't done.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-federal-judge-esther-salas-new-jersey-shooting-1.5656585?cmp=rss,news,world,
24989,2020-07-20 17:37,'Nothing is normal in 2020': LeBron James speaks out as NBA reports no new cases,"LeBron James keeps hearing the same questions. How's it going? How's the bubble?

He now has a one-size-fits-all answer.

""I just say it's 2020,"" James said. ""Nothing is normal in 2020.""

That's not entirely true. The NBA is a few weeks from playoff mode, and James — just like normal — has himself and the Los Angeles Lakers squarely in the mix to compete for championship. It is a rare bit of normalcy for a player who appeared in eight consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 through and including 2018, and for a franchise that has won 16 championships.

Everything else about this year has been most abnormal. A pandemic suspended play. David Stern, the NBA's commissioner emeritus, died. Kobe Bryant, who was the third-leading scorer in NBA history until James passed him on Jan. 25, died in a helicopter crash the following day. And now James, the Lakers and 21 other teams are at Walt Disney World, separated from the rest of the world, trying to salvage a season and decide a champion.

James took Bryant's death — the Lakers' star died along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others on the morning of Jan. 26 — particularly hard.

""A day doesn't go by when I don't think about him,"" James said. ""A day doesn't go by where our organization does not remember him and think about not only Kob, but Gigi, [his wife] Vanessa and their girls. They are a part of this family.""

Gearing up for playoffs

Lakers coach Frank Vogel has seen playoff-season James three times before — never liking how those experiences went. Vogel was coaching Indiana and his three best seasons there saw the Pacers matched up with James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference playoffs.

Heat in 6 in 2012. Heat in 7 in 2013. Heat in 6 in 2014.

This time, Vogel is genuinely and understandably eager to see James at playoff time.

""Obviously, it's been great having LeBron on our side after years of going against him,"" Vogel said. ""But in particular, when we get to the playoff environment, I've just seen how he is this year in some of the bigger regular season games, how he's more mentally locked in, more vocal, more making sure everybody else is locked in. And I anticipate that come playoff time, we'll see that all being done at an enhanced level.""

James will have a big say in whether the Lakers win that title. By the time the season resumes July 30, the ballots will be cast to determine whether he or Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo — the two frontrunners — wins the NBA MVP award. James is almost mathematically assured of winning his first assist title; he cannot be caught by second-place Trae Young of Atlanta no matter what happens at Disney. And the Lakers, barring all-out collapse, will be the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference.

By any measure, it's been a good year on the court for James.

A weird year, but a good year. Time will tell if it's a great year. He believes the bubble will work and sees no reason yet why this NBA experiment would fail. And while he detests being away from his family and his inner circle, he's using this chance to be locked in to focus on the opportunity.

""As far as the MVP race, I think I've shown what I'm capable of doing, not only individually but from a team's perspective, us being No. 1 in the West,"" James said. ""There was a lot of conversation about, you know, 'LeBron can do those things in the East but if he ever came to the West, what can he do?' I heard all of that, and to have our team at the top of the Western Conference and playing the way that we were playing at that time and the way I was playing, you know, that's definitely a good feeling.""

No new cases in past week

None of the 346 players tested for COVID-19 at the NBA campus in Florida returned positive tests over the past seven days, the league and union announced Monday.

That is a good sign that the ""bubble"" environment is working as the NBA prepares to resume the season on July 30.

Two players tested positive during the first week teams spent at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando from July 7-13, including Houston Rockets star Russell Westbrook.

Another 19 players tested positive for the coronavirus during in-market testing that began July 1 before the teams headed to central Florida.

The numbers continue to surge elsewhere in Florida. ABC News reported Monday there were 10,347 new cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the state's total to 360,394. The seven-day average has been greater than 10,000 over the last week, according to the state health department, and more than 5,000 have died in Florida.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/nba-lebron-james-speaks-los-angeles-lakers-1.5656656?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,nba
24988,2020-07-20 17:34,Blue Jays wind down camp ahead of abbreviated regular season on the road,"The Blue Jays closed up shop in Toronto on Monday to begin a most unusual road trip: a 60-game regular season that won't include a single visit to Rogers Centre.

Players are packing heavy. When Canada's lone Major League Baseball team might return north of the border is anyone's guess.

It definitely won't be this season after the federal government recently denied the team's request for permission to play home games this summer in Toronto, saying it's not safe for players to regularly travel over the Canada-U.S. border during the COVID-19 pandemic.

That decision meant a brief summer training camp would be the lone taste of home for the Blue Jays, who were to depart Monday night for two pre-season games in Boston ahead of Friday's opener at Tampa Bay.

It also forced team brass to shift into high gear on backup plans. Playing in a major-league facility is the team's preference but minor-league options are also being explored along with potential hybrid setups at both levels.

""Obviously it's evolving and a moving target,"" said Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins. ""That goes without saying. We want to make sure we have health and safety as a priority. The players' feedback and their perspective is exceptionally important to us.

""We're working very hard with Major League Baseball to come up with the most viable, realistic, safe options for our team.""

Atkins did not reveal which stadiums might be in the mix, but reports indicated Baltimore's Camden Yards, Washington's Nationals Park and Pittsburgh's PNC Park were among the possibilities. In a statement, Pirates president Travis Williams confirmed his team is discussing the PNC Park option with MLB and the Blue Jays.

During a half-hour video conference call with reporters, Atkins said the Blue Jays were exploring ""several scenarios,"" some of which could require some minor schedule adjustments.

""We will obviously have a much more extensive update for you when we have a better picture of what's the most realistic,"" he said.

The team's first so-called home game is July 29 against Washington. There was no word on when a final decision about a home venue has to be made.

""Yesterday would be great, right?"" Atkins said with a smile. ""We would all like to have direction and clarity ... we're all aligned. Our players are aligned, we're aligned, Major League Baseball is aligned, the union is aligned and we're solution focused.

""We'll do it as quick as we humanly can, making sure that we're not leaving something on the table as we consider all of those alternatives.""

If Sahlen Field in Buffalo gets the nod, Atkins said the rest of the team's 60-man player pool would train in nearby Rochester, N.Y. The downside with Buffalo, normally home to the triple-A Bisons, is that several adjustments would need to be made to get the facility to a big-league level.

A major-league ballpark is more appealing since it would have the required clubhouse size, proper lighting, workout facilities, bullpen setups and training areas. However, that option can come with snafus given the regular host team's schedule.

""Whatever it's going to be, just treat it as a two-month, on-the-road exploration somewhere,"" said infielder Joe Panik.

While the front office works on the issue, players are trying to focus on the upcoming season. The Blue Jays have spent the last two weeks preparing at Rogers Centre and living at the stadium's hotel.

""The time spent here in Toronto has been phenomenal,"" Atkins said. ""Our players are really jelling. I think for a lot of reasons, this was a very special opportunity for the group to be together for extended periods of time.

""They embraced it, they enjoyed it, you can feel and see the cohesion.""

Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said 38 players would make the trip to Boston. Stud prospect Nate Pearson will get the start Tuesday night at Fenway Park in Toronto's first pre-season game since the Grapefruit League shut down in March.

24984,2020-07-20 16:11,Pittsburgh Blue Jays? That's 1 option for Toronto's baseball team,"This is an excerpt from The Buzzer, which is CBC Sports' daily email newsletter. Stay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here.

Here's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:

The Blue Jays are looking for a home

There seems to be some confusion out there about what happened with the Jays over the last few days and what it means. So here it is:

On Saturday, the Canadian government officially rejected the Blue Jays' request to play their home games for the upcoming shortened season at the Rogers Centre in Toronto. This came a couple of days after a loosely worded TSN report saying the team had received ""government approval"" to host games at its home stadium. That report gave some people the impression that it was a done deal. But in fact, the Jays only had approval from the Ontario government, which was never in doubt. It was the federal government that still needed to give the green light — and ultimately decided not to.

Another source of confusion is why Canada won't let the Jays play at home when it's allowing the NHL to hold its playoffs in Edmonton and Toronto. The difference is that the NHL is setting up so-called ""bubble"" environments where players and staff are isolated from the general public and don't move around. Major League Baseball, on the other hand, is having its teams play out of their home stadiums. That means the Jays and visiting teams from various American cities would have been coming in and out of Toronto over the next couple of months. That was the deal-breaker for the federal government.

So where do the Jays go now? Two places immediately came to mind: Dunedin, Fla., and Buffalo, N.Y. Both cities would allow the Jays to set up shop there, and both have their advantages, but both have drawbacks too. Dunedin is where the team's spring-training headquarters are located, so the facility is familiar and has more big-league-calibre amenities than your typical minor-league park. But Florida is a notorious COVID-19 hotspot at the moment.

Buffalo has a low infection rate, is less than two hours down the highway from Toronto, and is home to the Jays' triple-A affiliate. But its stadium is bush-league. The field itself is mostly fine, but major leaguers would not find the back-of-the-house stuff (clubhouses, indoor batting cages, etc.) up to their standards. Both Buffalo's and Dunedin's stadiums would also need lighting upgrades in order to host major-league night games. And there's not much time to get that done.

So now the Jays are considering a stadium-sharing arrangement with another major-league team. Or teams. Judging by comments made to reporters over the weekend, this is what the players seem to want. Ideally, the Jays would play somewhere with a low infection rate that's located in the eastern United States (all their games this season are against AL East or NL East teams).

It's also important that the Jays' schedule matches up well with anyone they're sharing a stadium with. They can't both be playing at home at the same time. For all these reasons, the Jays are reportedly eyeing Pittsburgh's PNC Park (one of the best-looking ballparks in the game). But they'd still need to line up another stadium or two for the dates where their home games overlap with the Pirates'. Another option is hopping around between several parks, using whatever is available when the main tenant is on the road.

Whatever the Jays decide, they need to do it soon. Their first (and last) two exhibition games are Tuesday and Wednesday at Fenway Park. They open the regular season Friday night with the first of three games at Tampa Bay, followed by a pair at Washington, then the ""home"" opener on July 29. The clock's ticking.

The NFL is not special

While the pandemic battered nearly every sports league in the world — cancelled games, months-long hiatuses, millions in lost revenue — the richest one remained largely untouched. Save for having to scale down its annual draft spectacle and nix off-season minicamps, the NFL has barely sacrificed anything.

This was due almost entirely to lucky timing — the Super Bowl happened about a month before the pandemic really hit North America hard, and the 2020 season doesn't open until early September. But, given the NFL's vast resources and the fortune at stake in making sure the games kick off as scheduled, it seemed reasonable to assume the people in charge would parlay their stroke of good fortune into developing and executing the best possible plan for playing sports in the time of COVID-19.

Instead, it looks like they squandered much of their head start. Training camps are set to open in about a week, and the league and the players are still battling over return-to-play health protocols and economic issues — just like the NHL, NBA and MLB before them. Meanwhile, the NFL still hasn't ordered teams to play in empty stadiums — the only sensible-looking option for months now. Many teams are still clinging to the hope of partial-capacity crowds, which seems overly optimistic at best.

Odds are the NFL season will kick off as scheduled on Sept. 10. Too many people in the U.S. want it too badly to expect otherwise. But it's clear now that this league is not the well-oiled machine many assumed (or hoped) it was. Read more about the players' concerns and how they voiced them with a Twitter blitz here.

Quickly...

Patrice Bergeron is up for the Selke Trophy for the ninth consecutive time. The Bruins star has won the award, for the best defensive forward in the NHL, four times during that span — most recently in 2017. The other two finalists this year are St. Louis' Ryan O'Reilly, who won the Selke last year, and Philadelphia's Sean Couturier, who has never won it. The shortlist for the Norris Trophy for top defenceman was also revealed today: Tampa Bay's Victor Hedman, Washington's John Carlson and Nashville's Roman Josi. This is Carlson's first nomination, and he appears to be the front-runner after leading all defencemen with 75 points in 69 games. Read more about the Norris and Selke finalists here.



Mackenzie Hughes is on a roll. The Canadian golfer finished tied for third a few weeks ago, and yesterday he tied for sixth at the Jack Nicklaus-hosted Memorial Tournament — one of the better events on the PGA Tour. That performance, which included a 67-foot putt that Hughes drained for a birdie, earned him a spot in this year's U.S. Open. It also lifted Hughes to a career-best 75th in the world rankings. Spain's Jon Rahm is the new No. 1 after winning the Memorial by three strokes. Read more about Hughes and watch him sink that long putt here.



Max Domi rejoined the Canadiens. The 25-year-old forward, who has Type 1 diabetes, was given an extra week to decide whether to participate in the NHL's restart. Domi joined Montreal's training camp today, indicating he's decided to play. Domi had 17 goals and 44 points in 71 regular-season games for the Habs, who open a best-of-five playoff series vs. Pittsburgh on Aug. 1. Read more about Domi's return here.

And in case you missed it...

The National Women's Soccer League tournament got wild. The North Carolina Courage came into the Challenge Cup as favourites to win their third consecutive NWSL title, and they breezed through the preliminary stage with a perfect 4-0-0 record. The tournament's only unbeaten team wasn't expected to have much trouble with Friday's quarter-final matchup against last-place Portland Thorns FC — the only winless team. But Morgan Weaver scored in the 68th minute to lift Portland to a stunning 1-0 upset that eliminated the defending champs. And that was just one of the quarter-final surprises: No. 7 seed Sky Blue FC and the 6th-seeded Chicago Red Stars joined No. 8 Portland in the semifinals. The only favourite to advance was the 4th-seeded Houston Dash, which beat 5th-seeded Utah. Adding to the drama, the Houston, Chicago and Sky Blue wins all came via penalty shootout. The semifinal matchups (Portland vs. Houston, Sky Blue vs. Chicago) are both Wednesday, and the final is Sunday.

24991,2020-07-20 16:08,"Tensions between B.C. fishing lodges, Haida Nation escalate over COVID-19","RCMP in northwest B.C. say they will review video of a confrontation on the water near Haida Gwaii between members of the Haida Nation and staff of a local fishing lodge.

The video appears to show some five vessels from the Queen Charlotte Lodge passing too close to a pair of smaller Haida boats, leading to a tense verbal exchange.

Tensions have been rising on Haida Gwaii since the luxury fishing lodge, which is on the northernmost island of the archipelago, reopened despite a state of emergency in the Haida Nation because of COVID-19.

Locals are trying to ensure that the coronavirus does not spread in their remote community, where there are limited health services.

The Haida Nation, the Old Massett Village Council and the Skidegate Band Council have asked non-essential travellers not to visit the area.

The incident is thought to have occurred on Friday, and the edited video was posted on Facebook by a group of Haida matriarchs known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang, or ""Daughters of the Rivers,"" on Sunday.

WATCH | Edited and captioned clips of confrontation off Haida Gwaii:

Video provided to CBC by the Haida group Gaandlee Guu Jaalang shows edited and captioned clips of a tense interaction between Haida boats and Queen Charlotte Lodge fishing vessels. 2:52

Gaandlee Guu Jaalang member Adeana Young says the video illustrates how fishing lodges view the Haida people as an inconvenience, and put profit over safety

She says Haida people are in the waters near Queen Charlotte Lodge to catch fish.

""It's a matter of reminding our people that this is our inherent right that we've always had,"" said Young. ""To harvest our traditional food and occupy our unceded lands and waters.""

Queen Charlotte Lodge vice-president Brian Clive said members of the Haida Nation have been fishing near the lodge most days since the opening, and employees make sure they pass safely.

Clive said he has seen the video and, in his view, the lodge's boats were not too close.

He said he understands why some people are frustrated by the tours but said the lodge is following all provincial guidelines.

""We fly our guests from Prince Rupert to the shore of Naden Harbour,"" Clive said. ""We do not touch any community in Haida Gwaii.""

Tourism is currently allowed under the third stage of B.C.'s pandemic recovery plan. Another lodge, the West Coast Fishing Club, has also reopened to clients from B.C. and elsewhere in Canada.

Both lodges say they have measures in place to avoid contact with locals and have evacuation plans should a client become ill.

The RCMP detachment in Masset, B.C., say they will seek to review all video that was collected of the incident, will speak with both parties and consult with Transport Canada to determine if any regulations were contravened.

RCMP say both sides want a peaceful resolution.

'As protective as we can'

Haida Nation president Gaagwiis Jason Alsop reiterated on Sunday why extra precautions are needed to protect the islands' roughly 4,500 residents.

""We only have the two ventilators, and obviously we also have a significant population of elders on Haida Gwaii and we just want to be as protective as we can,"" he said.

He said that fishing lodges in Haida Gwaii should not reopen and should abide by state-of-emergency guidelines, which prohibit non-essential visitors.

""It's considered a disrespectful act to push ahead and breach those measures,"" said Alsop.

On Friday, officials with the Haida Nation said there was a self-reported case of COVID-19 from a resident.

The bulletin said there were also reports from community members who said they may have had coronavirus exposure and were self-isolating.

To date, there have been 68 cases of COVID-19 in the Northern Health Authority in B.C., which includes Haida Gwaii.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-tensions-haida-gwaii-1.5655735?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
24980,2020-07-20 15:48,Anxiety high as Canadian schools prepare for students from COVID-ravaged U.S.,"Post-secondary students from the pandemic-riven United States are getting ready to go back to school in Canada — a rite of passage that's causing more anxiety than usual for parents and front-line university workers alike in the age of COVID-19.

At Montreal's McGill University, some employees are growing worried the school prepares to welcome foreign students into on-campus residences, even those whose courses are entirely online.

Parents, too, are wrestling with new and unfamiliar concerns: the risk of on-campus infection, the fact border restrictions make in-person visits impossible and the prospect of their kids facing anti-American backlash.

One McGill employee, who spoke to The Canadian Press on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions at work, said there is concern among the rank and file of another ""fiasco"" like the outbreak at Quebec's long-term care homes, which accounted for 80 per cent of the highest provincial total of COVID-19 deaths in Canada.

""I am in the office with, like, four colleagues and we're all, 'What's going to happen?' In America, it's blowing up there like crazy, and people are supposed to be coming back in seven weeks,"" said the employee, who described the group as front-line workers — many in their 50s or 60s, with elderly parents at home — who are typically in close contact with students.

""There are a lot of family concerns related to health that are connected with this. And, you know, maybe I wouldn't be thinking about these things if I hadn't seen America erupt into such a mess.""

Others, however, have faith the institution can keep students and staff safe.

""Part of our mandate is to not only educate but nurture and protect these young adults,"" said Franco Taddeo, who's worked in McGill's library system since the 1990s. ""Honestly, as a father and Canadian, I would much rather have these students here for their safety and well-being than being in present-day America.""

The novel coronavirus has infected more than 3.6 million people and killed 140,000 in the U.S., compared with 109,000 cases and 8,800 deaths in Canada. And it's not the only thing giving U.S. parents sleepless nights.

They're well aware of reports of Americans — accused of flouting travel restrictions — facing verbal abuse in Canada.

'Wy life is waiting for me there'

One mother, a dual citizen who heard of U.S. vehicles being vandalized, bought a looseleaf-sized magnet to attach to her car door that reads, ""We are Canadian citizens and have completed our 14-day quarantine.""

Since students can complete course work online, one might wonder: why send them at all?

""We need to trust that she'll make decisions to keep herself safe, either there or here,"" said one mother, whose daughter is going into her second year at McGill, and who fears for her if her name is made public. The parents wrestled with whether to let her go.

""I kept saying to her, 'I would prefer you stay home and wait.' And she was like, 'But my life is waiting for me there.' So we're letting her make the choice.""

Quarantining in residence

In a statement, McGill would say only that fall courses will be offered ""primarily through remote delivery platforms,"" but that they are developing on-campus student life and learning activities ""which will respect careful safety protocols.""

""We will continue to place the health and safety of our community first by working closely with public health authorities.""

At the University of Calgary, some international students have spent the summer in residence to avoid going back to countries where the virus is rampant or travel restrictions made going home impossible, said Susan Barker, the vice-provost in charge of student experience.

New arrivals will quarantine in residence, while some who lack living arrangements will be sequestered at local hotels, Barker said. Students from the U.S. are not being treated any differently from those from elsewhere, she added.

""Our values as an institution are about fairness and equity,"" Barker said. ""We haven't had to make decisions that give students from somewhere preferential treatment over another.""

One quarter of U of T students from abroad

Some U.S. parents are taking comfort in knowing their children are escaping the U.S., where the newly resurgent virus is shattering daily records for new cases and deaths, fuelled by partisan divisions over face masks, reopening businesses and easing physical distancing requirements.

""It is completely bittersweet,"" said the father of a second-year McGill student from a hard-hit southern state, also worried his child might be targeted.

The good news, he said, is that his daughter ""has made a connection, made a life and found a place in a culture and country that has some sense of the common good.""

At the University of Toronto, where 23,000 international students comprised nearly a quarter of the school's 93,000-strong student body last year, a detailed and comprehensive plan is in motion to ensure the safety of all students, said Joe Wong, the school's vice-provost and associate vice-president, international student experience.

Last year, U of T had 722 undergraduates and 514 graduate students from the U.S., and so far 268 new American students have accepted offers of admission, he said.

""All three levels of government are co-ordinating right now — they really are setting the bar high in terms of what is a safe and secure corridor for students and universities across the country,"" Wong said.

""I can't speak for others, but I know that they're all working very hard to it, and the plan that we put together at U of T … goes above and beyond what most people expected.""

Students from outside Canada will be quarantined on campus for 14 days, regardless of whether they are planning to live on campus or not, Wong said, with daily check-ins with staff, meals delivered to their rooms and ""co-curricular"" programming to take part in while they ride out the waiting period.

""When they come out the other side of the quarantine, if they are healthy, then they will join the rest of the students who are on campus — of course, physically distanced and according to all the health authority's regulations.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/school-students-return-from-united-states-1.5656393?cmp=rss,news,politics,
24981,2020-07-20 15:27,Member of Health Quality Council of Alberta quits to protest legislation,"A member of the provincial body that's mandated to improve patient safety and the quality of health care in Alberta has quit, saying legislation proposed by the UCP government would eliminate its key role in the system.

In an open letter announcing his resignation from the Health Quality Council of Alberta, Ubaka Ogbogu says Bill 30 contains provisions that would strip the HQCA of its arm's-length relationship with the provincial government and allow the health minister to interfere in its work.

Bill 30, the Health Statutes Amendment Act, also proposes to cut approval times for private surgical facilities, allow the ministry to contract directly with doctors and let private companies take over the administrative functions of physician clinics.

""In my opinion, the changes will fundamentally and negatively transform the HQCA, thereby depriving Albertans of a key health-care institution charged with improving patient safety and health service quality,"" says the letter from Ogbogu, who also teaches law at the University of Alberta.

Earlier today, I resigned from the Board of the Health Quality Council of Alberta. The HQCA works independently and objectively to improve patient safety and health service quality for Albertans. Bill 30 takes that away. Read my resignation letter: <a href=""https://t.co/HefxrHY3mH"">https://t.co/HefxrHY3mH</a> —@UbakaOgbogu

""The HQCA is a leader and exemplar among health quality councils worldwide and is lauded for rigour, objectivity and the quality of its outputs. I believe the proposed amendments will irretrievably damage all these positive attributes.""

Ogbogu told CBC News that Bill 30 makes it untenable for him to continue to be on the HQCA board because the amendments would take away its originally intended purpose.

""It's like a total capture of the HQCA in a way that really decimates the organization's independence,"" he said.

""The HQCA is known worldwide for producing unbiased, objective evidence.""

Health Minister Tyler Shandro says Bill 30 would not make the council subject to the whims of the government.

""We are aligning ourselves with the models that other provinces have with their quality councils, and we think that's really important for us to make sure that the HQCA here in Alberta is aligned with government and ministry commitments and objectives,"" he said.

""I think this is a great opportunity for us.""

Ogbogu says in his resignation letter that the government did not consult the council about the elements of Bill 30 that would affect the council.

""This, in my view, is the last straw in a pattern of behaviour from the government that involves shutting out vital partners when considering fundamental changes to the health-care system,"" he said.

The council's board of directors issued a statement saying it respects Ogbogu's decision to leave and clarifies that the board ""was provided with a high-level overview of the amendments to the Health Quality Council of Alberta Act; however, it was not provided with details or asked to comment on the specifics prior to the tabling of Bill 30.""

The board said it's still waiting to have further discussions with the Shandro about the changes.

""The HQCA board wants to have a fulsome conversation about the issues raised, to ensure the HQCA can deliver on its legislated mandate and continue working hard to improve patient safety, person-centred care and health service quality for Albertans,"" the board said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/resignation-bill-30-health-quality-council-alberta-ubaka-ogbogu-1.5656285?cmp=rss,news,canada,calgary

The league said in a release Monday that 2,618 tests were completed on more than 800 players.

The two players that tested positive are currently in self-isolation.

Training camps opened July 13 to kick off Phase 3 of the league's return to play plan.

The NHL is scheduled enter Phase 4 on Aug. 1 when teams return to play in the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto.

The league said 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 in testing during Phase 2 of the plan, with another 13 testing positive outside of the league's protocol.

Phase 2, which ran from June 8 to July 12, allowed players to train in small groups at their teams' facilities.

24994,2020-07-20 15:18,NHL teams to contend with wide variety of game times when play resumes,"The puck dropping at all hours when the NHL resumes would be strange if life weren't strange already, according to Winnipeg Jets head coach Paul Maurice.

Game times when the 24-team qualifying round starts Aug. 1 range from noon to 10:45 p.m. ET in the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto.

West Coast fans of East Coast teams could be watching some games over breakfast.

The NHL has announced game times for the first three games of each best-of-five series. The remaining games will be revealed at a later date.

The lone all-Canadian matchup between the Calgary Flames and Winnipeg Jets features start times of 8:30, 12:30 and 4:45 p.m. local time over four days in Edmonton.

Maurice's point is that NHL training camps in July, after a four-month suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have already forced players and coaches out of their comfort zone, so what's another weird wrinkle?

""We won't have been in a routine, really, to feel we're coming out of a routine,"" Maurice said in Winnipeg on a Monday conference call with media. ""That kind of fits everything that's going on.""

The Jets have started some practices before 8 a.m. during camp to accommodate testing of players.

The Flames held their first intrasquad game Sunday — when Johnny Gaudreau was reunited with Sean Monahan and Elias Lindholm on Calgary's top line — at 8:30 p.m.

A second scrimmage Tuesday is scheduled for early afternoon.

""We're playing these games in training camp right now at different times, so guys can manipulate their morning routine or their game-day routine a little bit to get used to the different start times,"" Flames head coach Geoff Ward said.

Gaudreau spent the first week of camp skating in a nine-player pod separate from the main group before reuniting with his linemates Sunday.

Some teams will have consistent times to start the qualifying round.

The Pittsburgh Penguins and Montreal Canadians don't deviate from an 8 p.m. ET start their first three games in Toronto.

The Carolina Hurricanes versus the New York Rangers open with a pair of noon starts. That series flips from a noon game to an 8 p.m. puck drop on back-to-back days for Games 2 and 3.

Players are creatures of habit accustomed to a pre-game skate, nap and meal prior to an evening game. Teams do play occasional afternoon games on weekends and holidays.

""The day looks a lot different depending on the time of the game,"" Jets forward Mason Appleton said. ""I think for most guys, including myself, if it's a 12:30 [start] there's no such thing as a pre-game nap.

""If it's a later game I can try to get a nap in there. We're going to have to keep adjusting on the fly no matter what time the game.""

The earlier the game, the better for Flames forward Dillon Dube.

""It'll be hard mentally just being ready for different situations, but for me I love afternoon games,"" he said. ""You wake up, you don't overthink the game. You go out and play.

""Yesterday, even with the intrasquad, you're thinking about the game the whole day and it's all your day revolves around so I feel like it's a lot of fun to be able to go and play right away.""

To help players stay on top of a changing schedule, Maurice says it's important staff get each day's rundown to the players as early as possible so there are no surprises.

""Lay out the schedule early so they get a glance over it,"" he said.

A condensed schedule in the hub cities means preparation for the next game starts at the buzzer of the one just played, stated Ward.

""What you start doing from the end of the previous game I think is crucial in getting yourself prepared,"" the Flames coach said.

2 new cases after 800 players tested

The NHL says two players tested positive for COVID-19 during the first week of training camps.

The league said in a release Monday that 2,618 tests were completed on more than 800 players.

25009,2020-07-20 15:09,'I will be a little bit more at peace': Inuit leader reflects on report of CFL team changing name,"Natan Obed doesn't feel that he, himself, made the Edmonton football team change its name.

But the national Inuit leader — whose 2015 op-ed in The Globe and Mail brought the discussion into the national spotlight ahead of the team's Grey Cup victory — says if the reports are to be believed, Inuit can now move on to tackling other issues without this ""distraction.""

CBC News has not been able to verify the reports from TSN and Postmedia suggesting Edmonton's CFL club has come to an internal decision to change its name, with an announcement expected as early as this week.

A team spokesperson said, as of Saturday, there was no update regarding the name change.

But if the reports are true, it brings an end to a bitterly divisive debate that has played out not only in Southern Canada, but among Inuit across the country.

""That's something that weighs heavily on me because I hate to see our community and our people fight with one another over any issues. But let alone something that seems to be so personal,"" Obed, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), told CBC News.

Repairing relationships

Support and opposition for the team's name across Inuit Nunangat largely depended on demographics. Inuit in the Western Arctic were generally more supportive of the name, along with older Inuit; while those farther East, and the younger generations, predominantly supported a change.

In the fight for Inuit self-determination, we all want to feel like we're part of it. - Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami

Duane Smith, the chair of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation — and an ITK board member — told Sportsnet radio earlier this month many of his constituents found pride in Edmonton's team name.

The issue even reached Nunavut's Legislative Assembly in February, when cabinet minister Lorne Kusugak told opponents of the team's name to ""take a Valium"" and to stop being ""so sensitive"" during his member's statement.

Obed acknowledged there will be some who are upset with him over the reported outcome, comparing it to former Nunavut MP Nancy Karetak Lindell's voting in favour of same-sex marriage legislation, despite strong opposition from her constituents at the time.

""When the name changes, I will be a little bit more at peace and I hopefully will be able to now start repairing some of these relationships that have been broken through this discourse,"" Obed said. The issue for him, he said, was never over what Inuit think of the term, but rather about a business using it as a moniker.

""It was never about just blatantly criticizing and ridiculing anyone. This was about social justice. It is about systemic racism. And it is really about Inuit self-determination.

""I think that in the fight for Inuit self-determination, we all want to feel like we're part of it.""

Other issues to focus on

During a phone-in show on CBC Nunavut's Tausunni radio program on Friday, one caller suggested there are more important issues facing Inuit than a football team's name.

Obed agreed, but said this issue is important, too.

""Systemic racism has all sorts of different ways that it presents itself to Inuit,"" he said.

""And by this name being replaced, it ends one of those avenues for systemic racism to exist. And that to me is just so heartening in the face of so many other things that Inuit face every day.""

Obed also said this issue proved Inuit have a voice for change in this country.

""The fact that this name can change I think also shows that when we mobilize and when we use our voices and we stand up for things that we do right,"" he said.

""And it'll be hard. And our own community may not be with us at all steps along the way. But we're doing things that matter for Inuit, and for all Inuit coming in the future.""

Ending the use of the term in non-Inuit discourse

Asked if this reported decision from the CFL team is the turning point for non-Inuit to stop using the term altogether in social discourse, Obed said: ""Yes.""

""That is a huge victory for Inuit and for Inuit self-determination,"" he said.

""If Inuit within our communities want to use that term to describe themselves or describe their friends, or use the term, that is the pure discretion of Inuit and Inuit alone.

""I don't want my children being called [that term] by government, or by anyone that they interact with. And this decision by the Edmonton football team will make sure that it is not socially acceptable anywhere, for any non-Inuit, to use that term for any reason to describe us.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/edmonton-football-team-name-change-natan-obed-1.5654989,news,canada,north
24987,2020-07-20 14:57,"3 dead in Alberta tour bus crash were from Alberta, Saskatchewan and India","Two women in their 20s, one from Alberta, one from Saskatchewan, and a man in his 50s from India, have been identified as the three people killed Saturday when a tour bus rolled on the Columbia Icefield between Jasper and Banff, RCMP said Monday.

Jasper RCMP said the victims were a 28-year-old woman from Edmonton, a 24-year-old woman from Canoe Narrows, Sask., and a 58-year-old man from India. They said next-of-kin have been notified and the names of the victims will not be released.

There were 27 people on the bus, according to an RCMP statement. Of those injured in the crash, the statement said four people remained in critical but stable condition and one was in serious but stable condition as of late Sunday.

The cause of the rollover is still unknown, RCMP said, adding that a collision reconstructionist has confirmed there is no evidence that a rock slide caused the incident. They said the bus, called an Ice Explorer, will receive a full mechanical inspection.

The red and white big-wheeled buses regularly take tourists up a rough, rocky road onto the Athabasca Glacier in Jasper National Park.

The bus rolled off the road to the glacier Saturday afternoon, slid about 50 metres down a steep embankment and came to rest near the glacier on a rocky slope, its six huge tires pointed up at the sky.

The RCMP said they were trying to remove the Ice Explorer from where it landed, but that it may take several days due to the challenging terrain, as well as efforts to protect the physical integrity of the vehicle so it can be examined as part of the investigation.

Dave McKenna, president of the Banff Jasper Collection by Pursuit, the company that runs the bus tours and maintains the fleet of 22 vehicles, said they were co-operating with authorities and that an internal investigation is also underway.

McKenna said the Ice Explorers are off-road vehicles and seatbelts are not required. The vehicles aren't allowed on highways and have a top speed of 40 kilometres an hour.

He said once the investigation is complete, Pursuit will implement any changes that might be part of recommendations for things like seatbelts.

Tours have been offered on the glacier since 1969 and the current type of Ice Explorers have been used since the early 1980s, but are constantly upgraded, according to McKenna.

""We average about 480,000 visitors a year and we've been operating these vehicles since the early '80s,"" he said. ""We've had over 16 million passengers safely taken out onto the ice over all these years. No major incidents.

Prankur Gar, a second-year nursing student at MacEwan University, was on the icefield as part of a separate tour when the crash happened.

""There was a lot of injuries, there was a lot of blood. People were screaming, the bus was totalled — there was glass everywhere,"" Gaur said.

There were a lot of head injuries and some spinal injuries among the victims, Gaur said. He added he was impressed how well he and the other first responders worked together on the site with no authority before the RCMP arrived roughly 45 minutes after the crash occurred.

24999,2020-07-20 14:46,Veteran B.C. police officer not expected to survive after attack while off duty,"A police officer from Abbotsford, B.C., who was beaten while off duty in the Kootenays is not expected to survive his injuries, the Abbotsford Police Department said Monday.

Const. Allan Young, 55, was placed on life support at a hospital in the B.C. Interior after the attack in Nelson last week. A spokesperson for the department identified the officer and confirmed his medical status.

""[He is] a lovely, lovely man,"" said APD Sgt. Judy Bird. ""The space that he will leave is significant and it's hard ... we have sorrow. It is deep and we are so sad.""

Young was attacked after ""intervening in a disturbance"" in Nelson on Thursday.

Local police said Young approached another man downtown in the 600-block of Baker Street around midnight.

""It appears that one male was causing a disturbance in the roadway when the victim approached him and a physical altercation ensued,"" the Nelson Police Department said.

A 26-year-old man was arrested after the attack. Nelson police are investigating.

'He would light up the room'

Bird said Young was a 20-year police veteran who is leaving behind a family.

""He would light up the room. He had a very, very thick [Scottish] accent. If you could decipher the joke, it was usually very funny, but even if you couldn't understand what he said, the happiness and fun that he brought into a room was contagious,"" she said.

""I can't even imagine the turmoil and struggles that [his family is] having,"" she added. ""The decisions that have had to have been made over the past few days are torturous for any family.""

Chief Const. Mike Serr, the top officer with the Abbotsford police, said Young ""treated everyone with kindness and respect.""

""Everyone that met Allan would walk away happier. Allan was never too busy for his friends and family and there was nothing he wouldn't do to help,"" wrote Serr.

""Allan had a zest for life that was unparalleled, with a dedication and passion for policing and the Abbotsford Police Department.""

24979,2020-07-20 14:44,'Grim work': Climate-change clock ticking on world's polar bears,"The climate-change clock is ticking on the world's polar bears and a group of Canadian and U.S. scientists say they've determined when that time will run out.

The researchers used data on shrinking sea ice and detailed information on what the bears need to stay healthy and rear cubs to project the survival odds for 13 of the world's 19 bear populations through to the end of the century.

""It's very grim work,"" said Peter Molnar, a University of Toronto biologist who is the lead author on the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. ""The sad part is that we have known for a very long time what is going to happen.""

What hasn't been studied — until now — is when dramatic declines are likely to begin.

To determine those timelines, the researchers weighed what the bears need to live, reproduce and rear cubs against what their environment offers them.

""How long can a bear last on its energy stores?"" Molnar asked. ""What are some thresholds for a population beyond which reproduction and survival would decline?

""By using these new tools we can put numbers on when to expect these effects.""

Dwindling access to food

Polar bears depend on rich, fatty seals to get them through long periods of fasting, and they can only hunt that prey from sea ice — a platform rapidly shrinking due to climate change.

Foods on land, such as bird eggs, just don't have enough calories to keep the bears going over the long term.

""There's simply not enough energy on land in the places where bears live,"" Molnar said.

The researchers had enough information on projected ice conditions to forecast for eight of the 14 Canadian bear populations. They found cubs will be the first to go.

Even if the world were to manage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, bears in northern Ontario on the south coast of Hudson Bay will likely have trouble raising new bears by the end of this decade.

Their cousins along the west coast of Hudson Bay would likely follow a year later and those in the southern Beaufort Sea a few years after that. By the early 2040s, bears in Davis Strait would join them.

Those four groups represent nearly a third of Canada's total bear population. Cub-rearing problems for almost all the rest of them are considered likely to occur within similar timelines.

And that's the optimistic take.

Under a business-as-usual scenario, reproductive failure would become inevitable for Hudson Bay and Davis Strait bears beginning in the 2060s. By the 2080s, it's likely that adult bears in those regions would be starving to death.

""We all have physiological limits,"" said Molnar.

A few populations — those in the northern Beaufort or Queen Elizabeth Islands — will probably be fine.

""With business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, polar bears are going to be gone from probably everywhere except the very High Arctic,"" Molnar said.

He acknowledged the conclusions are based on assumptions — though well-researched — and mathematical models. But the group used the same approach to look backward and compared the results to data from the field.

In every case, the model results agreed. Field studies in western Hudson Bay found bears healthy and fat through the 1980s, then with declining reproductive success and body condition into the late 1990s.

""That is exactly what our model predicts,"" said Molnar. ""The model captures the dynamics of the past.""

The information in the paper should be useful to polar bear managers in the years ahead. But Molnar hopes it will have a wider impact than that.

""My hope is that showing how grim and dire the situation really is will emphasize one more time how urgent the problem of dealing with climate change is,"" he said.

""We know what needs to be done.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/climate-change-polar-bears-1.5656219?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
25011,2020-07-20 14:00,B.C. government's strict new rules on vape products coming into force this summer,"The B.C. government says sweeping new regulations on sales and marketing of vaping products will be in full effect by the end of the summer.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and Education Minister Rob Fleming spoke to the media about the province's ""action plan"" on vaping Monday morning, when they also announced a new youth advisory council that will come up with ideas to reduce vaping among young people.

""We heard from young people across the province that vaping companies are targeting them with a product that poses real and serious health and addiction risks,"" Dix said in a news release.

""We know youth are eager to get involved in this action, and I've seen promising work through early youth engagement to help influence their peers and stop this dangerous trend of addiction.""

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, vaping among young people rose by 74 per cent between 2017 and 2018. Dix said that while vaping is an important form of harm reduction for adults with nicotine addictions, it is simply harmful for children and teenagers who are introduced to tobacco through vape products.

The new council will launch in September.

Some say getting parents involved is crucial to protecting children from the harmful effects of vaping.

""We have at Clayton a number of parents who gave their kids vapes because they said it's not as harmful as smoking,"" said Baljit Ranu, a parent at Clayton Heights Secondary in Surrey and the principal of Semiahmoo Secondary

The new E-Substances Regulation was announced last November and caps the nicotine content in vapour pods and liquids at 20 milligrams of nicotine per millilitre, while requiring plain packaging with health warnings. It also prohibits non-nicotine or nicotine-cannabis blended vape products.

Meanwhile, changes to the Tobacco and Vapour Products Control Regulation mean that flavoured products can only be sold in adult-only stores, and no advertising is permitted in public spaces like bus shelters or parks where young people gather.

New retailers will be required to comply immediately with the new rules, while existing retailers will have until Sept. 15 to comply.

Many of them are forecasting their business will be severely reduced as a result.

""It is going to have a very large impact on us because a large portion of our stock is going to become obsolete,"" said Stacey White, co-owner of Thunderbird Vapes.

While she supports measures to protect children, she says she doesn't want vaping products to become inaccessible to people who use them for harm reduction.

Other parts of the province's plan are already in effect. Beginning on Jan. 1, the provincial sales tax on vaping devices and substances jumped from seven to 20 per cent.

The new rules were announced after a series of respiratory illnesses connected to vaping were reported across North America.

Vaping-related illness is an inflammation of the lungs, with symptoms that include coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vaping-laws-update-bc-1.5656157?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
24970,2020-07-20 13:31,Bruins' Bergeron up for record 9th straight Selke Trophy,"Boston's Patrice Bergeron and Tampa Bay's Victor Hedman are becoming regulars at the NHL's annual award night.

Bergeron was named a finalist for a record ninth straight Selke Trophy as the league's top defensive forward, while Hedman is up for his fourth consecutive Norris Trophy as top defenceman.

Bergeron has won four Selke Trophy's previously, while Hedman has taken home one Norris.

The other two finalists for the Selke are Philadelphia Flyers centre Sean Couturier and St. Louis Blues centre Ryan O'Reilly, while Hedman is up against John Carlson of the Washington Capitals and Roman Josi of the Nashville Predators.

Bergeron, a 24-year-old centre from Ancienne-Lorette, Que., helped the Bruins allow a League-low 174 goals as the team finished atop the NHL standings. He led Boston forwards in shifts per game (22.9), playing an average of 18 minutes 44 seconds — including 1:43 on the penalty kill — while finishing 15th in the NHL in plus/minus (plus-23). Bergeron also ranked fifth in the league with 759 face-off wins.

Couturier led the NHL by winning 59.6 per cent of his faceoffs (542-for-909). He was consistent throughout the ice, winning 59.5 per cent of his faceoffs in the defensive zone, 60.4 per cent in the neutral zone and 59.1 per cent in the offensive zone. No other NHL player topped 58 per cent in all three zones.

The 27-year-old from Bathurst, N.B., who finished second in Selke Trophy voting in 2017-18, also led all Philadelphia skaters with a plus-21 rating while pacing team forwards in both total time on ice (1,368:23) and shorthanded time on ice (140:29).

O'Reilly, the reigning Selke Trophy winner, led the NHL in face-off victories (880) for the third consecutive season, making him the third player to achieve that feat since the statistic was introduced.

Hedman ranked third among defencemen in scoring with 55 points (11 goals, 44 assists) in 66 games, marking his fourth consecutive season with at least 40 assists and 50 points. During the Lightning's 23-2-1 run from Dec. 23 through Feb. 17, Hedman posted an even-or-plus rating in 22 of the 26 games (plus-29 in all) and played an average of 25 minutes 43 seconds per contest.

The 29-year-old Ornskoldsvik, Sweden, native is the first Norris Trophy finalist in four consecutive seasons since countryman Nicklas Lidstrom with the Detroit Red Wings was selected from 2005-06 through 2008-09. Hedman became the first Lightning player to capture Norris honours in 2017-18.

Carlson helped the Capitals to a first-place finish in the Metropolitan Division for a fifth consecutive season by leading all NHL defencemen in scoring with 75 points (15 goals, 60 assists) in 69 games.

Josi led the Predators in scoring with 65 points (16 goals, 49 assists) in 69 games, joining Carlson as the only defenceman to top his club in points this season. Josi's 65 points set a franchise record for defencemen, surpassing the 61 he had recorded in 2015-16, and his 16 goals marked a career high.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-awards-norris-trophy-selke-trophy-1.5656190?cmp=rss,sports,hockey,nhl
24969,2020-07-20 13:14,"Manitoba spends big to host CFL season, attract other events","Manitoba is spending $8 million to restart large events, including $2.5 million on a bid to have the CFL play the truncated 2020 season in Winnipeg as a hub city.

""Manitoba is leading in recovery with a safe plan to restart our economy, which is why we are ready to make another important investment that supports the restart of our economy and invite the CFL to safely play its shortened 2020 season in Winnipeg,"" Premier Brian Pallister said Monday.

""We are excited to work with Travel Manitoba and key economic stakeholders to develop our RestartMB event attraction strategy that will benefit the entire provincial economy, but in particular, the hardest-hit sectors of tourism and hospitality, namely restaurants and hotels.""

The strategy as a whole aims to support Winnipeg and rural destinations in their bids to host large-scale meetings, conventions and events and to restart the Manitoba economy, Pallister said.

As for the $2.5 million earmarked for CFL games, the money would go toward expenses that include:

Food and accommodations.

Practice field rentals.

Group transportation.

Event-specific expenses in Manitoba.

Pallister estimates the province's $2.5 million would result in ""substantial economic spinoffs"" if Winnipeg were named as the CFL hub city.

A recent economic impact analysis estimates approximately 800 players, team staff and league staff would visit the city, resulting in the equivalent of 55,000 hotel room night stays, Pallister said. That would generate approximately $3.8 million for the provincial economy, he said.

It also estimates $45 million in business sales and $4.5 million in direct tax would be generated.

Should Winnipeg win the full bid to serve as hub city, it would host 60 football games televised across Canada as well the city would also host the 108th Grey Cup game.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/premier-pallister-cathy-cox-event-attraction-1.5656014?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba
24967,2020-07-20 13:02,Liberals review rollout of social finance fund to combat pandemic fallout,"The federal government is taking a second look at how quickly it will dole out hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to social services looking to tap into new sources of capital, particularly as COVID-19 dries up traditional donations.

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's office said the government is reviewing the launch of what's known as the ""social finance fund"" given the pandemic.

The pandemic has had a deep financial effect on households, many of which have paused discretionary spending on things like charity while the economic uncertainty persists.

The Liberals already had embarked on a path to provide new sources of revenue to charitable and non-profit social services by connecting them with private investors to test new — and potentially cheaper and more effective — ways of delivering their services.

The idea is that investors will front the money for projects to address social problems, and the government will reward those investments if the projects work.

Liberals re-examining timeline for $755 million fund

Hussen heard a pitch earlier this month to speed up delivery of hundreds of millions of federal dollars to build out this socially conscious investment system, and increase the amount offered to social-service groups unaccustomed to pitching investors to help them land the cash.

A spokesperson for Hussen says the Liberals are re-examining the timelines and the approach for the launch of the social finance fund to help cash-strapped groups whose services are in high demand.

""The need to innovate for communities is all the more urgent in light of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Jessica Eritou said in a statement.

""We acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has created financial and operational challenges that make it difficult for many organizations to innovate at a time when they are most needed.""

The goal of social financing is to bring private money into social services governments typically either provide themselves or pay for directly — sometimes ineffectively.

Instead of directly funding positions for specific groups at a company, for instance, a group would use private funding to test a way to train up marginalized workers with specific skills.

Government funds would flow if a project — such as one finding housing for people for whom current programs haven't worked — proves successful through detailed data.

The Liberals have set aside $755 million in a social-finance fund, and a further $50 million spread over last year and this fiscal year to help about 500 groups build capacity to take part in the growing field.

The government had banked on $85 million annually from the fund going out over a four-year period starting this fiscal year, for a total of $340 million.

Groups want more money for capacity building

The pitch Hussen heard at the start of July was for $400 million over the next two years — more than double what the government planned on — to capitalize existing and emerging funding groups, as well as Indigenous-led organizations.

Groups are also asking the government to provide a further $150 million to expand capacity-building programs.

""If there are allocations made to increase that amount going to these capacity-building organizations, then they can roll out a variety of support programs to support dozens, if not hundreds, of enterprises beginning the fall,"" said Adam Spence, chief executive of Social Venture Connexion, which works with and connects investors, social finance funds and service groups.

Some of these social-finance groups have seen their revenues drop by 70 per cent due to COVID-19, mirroring similar drops in traditional giving experienced by charities since the pandemic struck Canada in March, Spence said.

The project money would come next, with a target to pull in $800 million in private capital so that funding groups could put cash into projects and local organizations beginning in late fall, Spence said.

Speeding up and adding spending could help 10,000 social-purpose organizations adapt to the crunch COVID-19 has created for them, and maintain or create jobs targeting newcomers, youth, Black and Indigenous people.

""Each of these is going to contribute to the tax base, but also and perhaps more importantly, tackle a whole host of social, economic and environmental challenges that we're all facing,"" Spence said.

Almost three dozen people from across the country took part in a virtual meeting with Hussen earlier this month.

Spence said the group remains hopeful but also plans to redouble its efforts by lobbying local MPs through the summer.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-review-social-finance-fund-1.5656098?cmp=rss,news,politics,

Domi had been evaluating the risks of returning to play amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The Centers for Disease Control has said that Type 1 diabetics are among those who might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

24959,2020-07-20 11:50,Wolfpack pull out of remainder of rugby's Super League season,"Toronto Wolfpack won't be taking the pitch when the Super League season resumes Aug. 2, citing in a Monday news release ""unexpected and overwhelming financial challenges"" due to the global pandemic.

The Wolfpack also won't compete in the remainder of the 2020 Coral Challenge Cup as ""greatly reduced ticket, sponsorship, merchandise and game day revenue streams have resulted from the loss of all 11 of the team's home Super League games in Toronto.""

The club said it intends to field a team in 2021 and will be working with Super League Europe and the Rugby Football League to understand the process moving into next season.

""This decision has not been taken lightly,"" read the Wolfpack statement. ""The Wolfpack would be left covering significant additional costs simply to complete a season of games in the U.K. including COVID testing, stadium rentals, medical costs and player pay increases to align with the rest of the league.""

The Canadian Press quoted Rugby league authorities last week saying they were working with the Toronto club to resolve a visa issue that could derail the transatlantic team's attempt to resume play in England this summer.

Winless start

At issue are the visas that allow New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports — Australia's Josh McCrone, Darcy Lussick and Blake Wallace, Australian-born Samoan international Ricky Leutele and New Zealand's Chase Stanley and Bodene Thompson — to play in England.

The visas allow for six months in England over a year, which is not a problem when the Wolfpack are spending part of the season in Canada.

But the global pandemic has kept the players in England and the visas are slated to expire at the end of the month.

The Wolfpack (0-6-0) hadn't played since March 11 with play suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those games were contested in England, where Toronto had planned to continue playing because of travel and other restrictions.

According to the news release, refunds for all 2020 single game tickets as well as season membership refunds that have been requested by individual fans, will be returned by the club to Ticketmaster in the near future in order for the refund process to be fulfilled.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/rugby/toronto-wolfpack-season-withdrawal-rugby-1.5656055?cmp=rss,sports,rugby,
24954,2020-07-20 11:45,Scheer says Liberal MPs signalling they're OK with 'corruption' if they don't demand Trudeau's resignation,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today Liberal MPs should push for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation as he faces his third ethics investigation — this time for his handling of the multi-million dollar WE Charity student grants contract.

Scheer said that if Liberal backbenchers don't call for Trudeau's departure now, they'll be complicit in his alleged ""corruption.""

""If they allow him to continue, if they don't demand that he resign, then they are telling Canadians that they are comfortable with his corruption,"" Scheer told reporters during a press conference on Parliament Hill.

""Each and every one of them has a choice to make,"" he said of Liberal MPs.

Trudeau apologized for not recusing himself from cabinet talks about the WE Charity deal after it was revealed his mother and brother received some $300,000 in speaking fees from the group. Finance Minister Bill Morneau also has said he made a mistake by participating in those talks when his daughter works for the charity in its travel department.

Parliament is returning today to debate new COVID-19 relief legislation. Trudeau is not scheduled to be in attendance.

According to his official itinerary, Trudeau is taking a ""personal"" day.

""He chose the date in which the House of Commons would reconvene and he's not showing up for work today,"" Scheer said.

Scheer's comments come after Liberal MPs filibustered the House of Commons ethics committee meeting last Friday with 30-minute long monologues on various topics — their personal resumes, democracy, ancient Greece, French political theory and the virtues of the University of Sherbrooke, among others — that pushed the committee meeting's duration well past its scheduled end time.

Liberal MP Greg Fergus then moved to adjourn the committee before there could be a vote on an ethics probe.

Scheer said he hopes the MPs behind the filibuster are punished by their constituents at the ballot box during the next federal election.

""We're going to appeal to Canadians to put pressure on Liberal MPs to do the right thing,"" Scheer said.

The Commons will return today to debate a new piece of government legislation, C-20. If adopted, the bill will make changes to the federal wage subsidy program and send one-time payments to disabled Canadians.

The legislation has the support of the Bloc Québécois but Scheer said he's concerned that the Liberals' tweaks to the wage subsidy have made the program too ""complex.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-trudeau-we-scandal-1.5655990?cmp=rss,news,politics,

24960,2020-07-20 11:37,"For Black skater Mariyah Gerber, something as simple as a costume illustrates problem of lack of diversity","Mariyah Gerber has been a figure skater for 22 years and over all that time she couldn't find costume mesh or tights that matched her skin.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the sport's diversity problem.

""Representation matters, one hundred per cent,"" Gerber said. ""You're constantly in a space where you're told you don't have the look, you're not beautiful.

""And it's hard to feel beautiful when you're looking around and the idealistic thing about beauty has nothing to do with anything you possess.""

Gerber began her skating career at age five in Riverside, Calif. Her grandmother was the one who signed her up for lessons, and years later signed her up to audition for a Black role in a major skating tour. Gerber got the part, so instead of heading to college as planned, she hopped on a plane at just 17 years old to begin her 10-year-career skating in shows around the world.

Gerber stepped away from the role in 2016 and calls the experience amazing. But she also walked away with the stark reality that no matter what level she was skating at, the sport's environment and standards did not reflect skaters of colour.

CBC Sports special report on diversity:

Mesh and tights were an ongoing issue for Gerber. To this day, very few companies sell shades matching all skin tones. Even as a professional, Gerber was fielding questions from costume designers on where to find tights in her skin tone and teaching them how to dye her mesh the right shade.

""I'll never forget, the season before my last, [the costume designers] put me in a costume that was fully white mesh,"" Gerber said. ""And I remember they looked at it and said 'It doesn't look that bad.' And I feel like the words 'it doesn't look that bad' is also a mild way of saying 'we know it's not right, but it is what it is.'

""And it's like, I've worked this hard to get to where I am but I still don't feel like I'm supposed to be a part of this sport.""

In that specific case, Gerber spoke up about her discomfort and the costume was remade with better materials. But Gerber knows that's not an option for many skaters, especially young athletes of colour who get most of their equipment and costumes at pro shops.

WATCH | The need for more diversity in Canadian sports:

Canadian universities and national sports groups say they have to do more to diversify their coaching staff and leadership, after CBC Sports carried out a visual audit and found the vast majority of those positions are held by people who are white. 2:10

""I felt so uncomfortable speaking out and saying if I'm going to be out there, it has to be right,"" she said. ""I felt that way because of years prior feeling like I couldn't really truthfully say my piece or share how I feel about the costumes or things I was being put in.""

Gerber one day hopes to create a mechanism which pro shops, costume designers and parents can use to find companies that sell mesh and tights for all skin tones. But she wishes those in charge would spend as much time researching costume and representation details as they do other aspects of their shows.

""Things like that would be a huge step in the right direction to make sure people of colour feel included in a sport,"" said Gerber.

Gerber didn't meet many other Black skaters on tour but formed friendships with those she did, praising the support they offered one another in a very competitive atmosphere.

But that lack of diversity reflected the lack of diverse roles. Gerber skated one of the few lead Black roles in her show, while most BIPOC skaters skated in the ensemble. Gerber usually did not have a Black understudy and even when she did her role would often be played by skaters of other ethnicities.

""I remember when my understudies would go in, I always felt bad,"" she said. ""I could see when little kids came [to watch], dressed up in their prince and princess costumes, you could see the automatic disappointment in their faces when the character came out because they saw everybody else looking like the movie, but then that character comes out and it's somebody who's not Black.

""And it's just another moment or instance where something that was supposed to be meant for you is taken away.""

What made it worse for Gerber was never seeing a BIPOC skater take a traditionally white role. And the tour company did get complaints about representation, which Gerber thinks is the reason for the role steadily being taken out of the show over the years.

""It's so much easier to find someone who can do five characters than to find someone to fit the criteria for one character and to highlight them properly and make sure they're well represented to the community,"" said Gerber.

""I always knew, but I know more now than ever, that it is so important we remain represented and that we're represented correctly.""

To deal with all of this, Gerber says community and highlighting talent are both more important than ever, which is why she's part of the Figure Skating Diversity & Inclusion Alliance, a new working group tackling a myriad of projects to promote visibility, form support systems, create inclusive policy and more.

""We are underrepresented, we are not lifted up and shared and honestly, I've realized now how what we are fighting for is being more well-connected to one another,"" she said. ""I feel like what has been lacking in our community has been that community of people who are right there, ready to answer your questions and say ""Hey, what happened to you isn't right and we're able to help make it right"" and to not have people feel alone.

""You're constantly in a space where you're told you don't have the look, you're not beautiful. It took me years to be able to feel beautiful in my own skin and appreciate it and all that I do, and I really think a lot of that had come from skating.""All that is compounded by how expensive skating has become, especially for athletes looking to reach a professional or Olympic level.

For these issues to still exist at the professional level makes Gerber even more concerned for young BIPOC skaters with dreams of their own.

""It comes down to strength. It's hard to be the only Black skater in your rink, in your region, in your section,"" she said. ""Maybe when you're six, seven, even eight it's all fun, but once it starts getting more competitive and you start getting better and you look around and don't see anyone who looks like you, I feel like it discourages you from continuing.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/figureskating/diversity-sports-figure-skater-mariyah-gerber-1.5655858?cmp=rss,sports,olympics,winter

She has accused him of abusing her both physically and verbally during their tempestuous relationship.

The 57-year-old Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of the Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, at the court in London over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater.""

The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard.

In the first session of her testimony that is expected to last for three days, Heard denied accusations that she was a heavy drug-taker and drinker as well as being controlling and abusive herself.

She also described an incident in January 2015 in a hotel room in Tokyo over a prenuptial agreement between herself and Depp.

She testified there was an argument in the room that resulted in Johnny kneeling on her back and hitting her on the back of the head.

In written testimony released as she took to the witness box, Heard said she worried Depp would kill her at various times during their relationship that saw her enduring ""punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking.""

She also said ""some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far.""

24936,2020-07-20 10:46,'We're not going to apologize': U.S. officials defend crackdown in Portland,"Top U.S. Homeland Security officials say they have no intention of pulling back in Portland, Ore., and defended the federal crackdown on anti-racism protests in the country, including the use of unmarked cars and unidentified officers in camouflage.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sent law enforcement units to Portland to back up the Federal Protective Service responsible for guarding government facilities after receiving intelligence about planned attacks around July 4, the DHS officials said.

""DHS is not going to back down from our responsibilities. We are not escalating, we are protecting,"" Chad Wolf, acting secretary of Homeland Security, told Fox News.

President Donald Trump condemned protests in Portland and violence in other ""Democrat-run"" cities on Sunday as his administration moves to intervene in urban centres he said have lost control of demonstrations. Protests began across the country after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minneapolis in late May.

Last week, federal officers started cracking down on crowds, using tear gas to disperse protesters and taking some into custody in unmarked cars.

Officers without clear identification

On Monday morning, Portland Police provided details on another tense night between protesters and federal law enforcement in the city, saying federal agents used tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside a federal courthouse downtown.

Wolf said federal law enforcement was doing its job.

""We're not going to apologize for it,"" he said. ""We're going to do it professionally and do it correctly.""

The clampdown in Portland has drawn widespread criticism and legal challenges as videos surfaced of officers without clear identification badges using force and unmarked vehicles to arrest protesters without explanation.

Ken Cuccinelli, the acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deputy secretary, said the federal officers wore the same uniforms every day and the crowds knew who they were. He also defended the use of unmarked cars as routine.

""Unmarked police vehicles are so common it's barely worth discussion,"" he told CNN.

Cuccinelli said if federal authorities receive the same kind of intelligence threat in other places, they would respond the same way.

""It's really as simple as that,"" he said.

Democrats demand answers

On Sunday, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives demanded internal investigations into whether the Justice and Homeland Security departments ""abused emergency authorities"" in handling the Portland protests.

Portland's mayor called the intervention an abuse of federal power and said it was escalating the violence. Oregon's attorney general filed a lawsuit against the federal agencies, saying they had seized and detained people without probable cause.

Cuccinelli dismissed local leaders' calls to leave the city.

24946,2020-07-20 10:45,Ballon d'Or for world's best soccer players won't be awarded for 1st time in 64 years,"The prestigious Ballon d'Or will not be awarded this year because the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the soccer season.

Awarded by France Football magazine, the Ballon d'Or has been given out every year since Stanley Matthews won the first one in 1956. Lionel Messi has won it a record six times, one more than longtime rival Cristiano Ronaldo.

The magazine started giving out a women's award in 2018, but that has also been put on hold.

""It's such a strange year that we couldn't treat it as an ordinary one. Let's say that we started talking about [making the decision] at least two months ago,"" France Football editor Pascal Ferre told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

""It isn't a decision we took lightly but we had to accept it couldn't be a normal or typical Ballon d'Or winner, and what really worried us it that it wouldn't be fairly awarded.""

Because the game's rules have been modified during the pandemic, the award itself was impacted.

""The season started with certain rules and ended with other rules. In January and February, soccer was played in front of full stands. Then from May and June it was with empty stands,"" Ferre said. ""Then we had the five substitutes rule and not three. Then other changes happened in terms of the competitions, notably the final eight [eight-team knockout format] for the Champions League when it had started with home and away legs.""

Other awards cancelled

With the European Championship and the Copa America postponed this year, the Champions League would have massively weighed on the award's outcome but with a format inadvertently providing a shortcut for an eventual victor.

""The Ballon d'Or would have been decided over just three games: quarter-final, semifinal, final,"" Ferre said. ""There were loads of changes [to soccer's rules] which are totally legitimate and which we don't contest given the worldwide health crisis, but we couldn't consider this as a typical year. Exceptional circumstances led to an exceptional decision.""

The Kopa Trophy for the best player under 21 and the Lev Yashin award for best goalkeeper have also been cancelled this year, Ferre said.

Ronaldo, who will be 36 in February, can still win an Italian league-Champions League double with Juventus this season, but he is not the only player affected by France Football's decision.

Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski reached 50 club goals for the first time and can win a treble. Kylian Mbappe and Neymar can clinch quadruples for Paris Saint-Germain.

""Look at Lewandowski's performances this year, his form has been at the level of Messi and Ronaldo,"" Ferre said. ""And Paris players, imagine if they win the Champions League.""

To maintain the award's authenticity and level of suspense, players were not informed of the decision before the announcement.

The Best awards by FIFA now prized honour

""We are independent and autonomous enough not to have to raise our little finger and ask what they think,"" Ferre said. ""We will take their frustration as a sign of their attachment to the award.""

Without the Ballon d'Or, The Best awards by FIFA will be the prized individual honours in world soccer this year.

FIFA plans to organize the voting in several categories but it is unclear how or where the awards will be made.

If the virus impacts next season the same way, however, the Ballon d'Or award will be awarded.

""It would be less of a problem in terms of fairness, because this time around we've had two parts to the season: normal and not normal,"" Ferre said. ""Imagine that in 2021 all matches are played behind closed doors [without fans] and with five subs. We would adapt, because it would be comparable.""

To fill this year's gap, the magazine created another trophy: the France Football Dream Team.

The magazine's jury of 180 will elect history's best team from a shortlist of five players in each position. The star-studded lineup will be known sometime in autumn.

24963,2020-07-20 10:31,"Toronto, Peel, Windsor-Essex to stay in Stage 2 of Ontario's COVID-19 recovery plan","Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex public health units will not be entering Stage 3 of the province's COVID-19 recovery plan this week, sources told CBC News on Monday.

The other seven public health units still in Stage 2 are set to get a green light from Premier Doug Ford later today to proceed into the next stage of reopening.

This means that by the end of the week, 31 of Ontario's 34 public health units will have moved into Stage 3, which allows for activities such as indoor dining in restaurants, live performing arts shows and the reopening of movie theatres and playgrounds.

Twenty-four health united entered into Stage 3 last Friday.

(CBC)

Ford is scheduled to hold his daily COVID-19 briefing beginning at 1 p.m. ET from Queen's Park. Ford's office says he will be joined by Elliott and Rod Phillips, minister of finance. You can watch the briefing live in this story.

Toronto, Peel and Windsor Essex account for 78 of the 135 new cases of COVID-19 reported by the Ministry of Health this morning. Another 20 were confirmed in Ottawa.

The new cases mark a 0.4 per cent increase in total infections of the novel coronavirus in Ontario, slightly above what has been typical in recent weeks. They come after two days with more than 160 new cases each over the weekend.

Ontario has now seen a total of 37,739 cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak began in late January. Of those, about 88.8 per cent are considered resolved. Another 106 were marked resolved today.

Twenty-eight public health units reported five or fewer cases in the latest update, Health Minister Christine Elliott noted in a series of tweets. Of those 28, 18 public health units confirmed no additional cases at all.

There are now about 1,474 active cases of COVID-19 provincewide.

Meanwhile, Ontario's official COVID-19 death toll grew by one, and is now 2,752. A CBC News count, however, puts the real current toll at 2,781 as of yesterday evening.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-coronavirus-ontario-july-20-update-1.5655887?cmp=rss,news,canada,toronto
24938,2020-07-20 9:16,"World's largest cricket processing plant coming to London, Ont.","London, Ont. will soon be home to the world's largest indoor cricket farm.

Aspire Food Group, a global industry leader in the production of edible insects, will soon build a 100,000-square-foot plant that will bring bugs, as food, to the North American market.

The new facility will be one of the most technologically advanced and energy-efficient protein production systems in the world.

""This first-of-its-kind commercial facility will enable not just Aspire Food Group, but our entire growing sector to take an important stride forward in our mission to deliver an excellent-value protein at a fraction of the environmental impact of most conventional protein sources,"" said Mohammed Ashour, co-founder of Aspire Food Group.

The food of the future

Aspire farms processes crickets into ""all-natural, sustainable, superfood ingredients that are nutritionally superior to livestock, cell-cultured, and plant-based alternatives.""

The company has purchased 12 acres of land in Innovation Park near Veterans Memorial Parkway and Highway 401. Construction will begin in August and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.

Once the plant opens, it will employ about 60 people to help meet the demand for alternative protein products for both the human and pet food markets.

London's mayor Ed Holder is excited to welcome the new facility to London.

""This highly innovative and internationally renowned firm represents a significant addition not only to London's growing food and beverage sector but also to Innovation Park where Aspire's facility will soon occupy 12 acres.""

""With our economy in the early stages of recovery, Aspire Food Group's imminent arrival is proof that London's industrial land strategy is succeeding at expanding and growing our workforce in new and diverse ways,"" Holder added.

Health benefits

Many of us can't imagine popping a cricket into our mouths as a snack. But studies show that eating insects could be good for you and the planet.

Insects are a great source of protein and minerals, such as iron, zinc and magnesium. They include a protein called chitin that encourages healthy bacteria to grow in your stomach.

Also, 100 grams of insects (crickets, beetles, red ants and grasshoppers) contains almost the same amount of protein as meat, but with less fat and fewer calories.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/worlds-largest-cricket-processing-plant-coming-to-london-1.5655813?cmp=rss,news,canada,london
24934,2020-07-20 9:00,Public hearing into policing in Edmonton brings back painful memories for Cree brothers,"Rob Houle sits in the backyard of his St. Albert home. His youngest boy floats around the yard. He has a short attention span but an insatiable curiosity.

Houle, 36, is originally from the Swan River First Nation in northern Alberta. His hair is braided under a wide-brimmed beaded hat. He prefers the name Rob; Robert is his dad.

He sits at ease in his backyard surrounded by the organized mess that comes with having three kids.

He's gentle with his son even while sharing details about what he says was one of the most difficult moments of his life — an altercation with police that left him scarred.

On June 15, Houle faced Edmonton's city council to describe the night 15 years ago when, he says, he and his brother were assaulted by police officers and driven around the city in the back of a van for more than an hour.

He was one of 150 people to speak out on the role the Edmonton Police Service should play in the city. He came forward, he says, hoping his past relationships with council members — many who he worked alongside while working for the city — would encourage them to listen.

While the Edmonton Police Service says it is trying to identify the two officers involved in Houle's complaint, it has not responded to the allegations in this story, none of which have been proven in court.

A birthday celebration

It was April 2005, a couple months after Joel Houle's 18th birthday. He had driven three hours from Slave Lake, Alta., to go to the bar in Edmonton for the first time with his older brother, who he calls Robbie.

They went to Esmeralda Night Club, a bar on Kingsway Avenue. They were both fairly intoxicated when an altercation occurred inside the bar between Joel and another patron, Houle said.

Bouncers ejected the brothers without their coats.

Outside Joel became agitated, wanting to get his jacket. A short time later police rolled up.

Officers handcuffed and pepper sprayed his brother, Houle said.

Because Joel didn't live in Edmonton, Houle worried about his brother and told police if they arrested Joel, they should arrest him too.

Houle said he was put in an armbar and taken down, the officer putting a knee on his chest. Neither of the young men resisted, Houle said.

""Not having much kind of interaction with police and police authorities … [we were] kind of scared, worried what was going to happen,"" Houle said. ""Once the officer has you on the ground and has all his body weight on your chest and you can't move, you can't breathe, can't do any of that stuff ... [I] just [felt] general terror.""

Houle said they were placed in the back of a police van without explanation. Joel, who was crying in pain because of the pepper spray, lay face down on the floor of the back. Houle was sitting handcuffed on one of the benches.

""I just remember them specifically saying, 'If you don't shut your mouth, we're going to drop you off outside of Edmonton,'"" Joel said. ""And they laughed.""

The next hour or two were a blur, Houle said. Police drove the van around the city, braking hard and taking corners quickly.

At one point Houle's head snapped back, hitting the wall. He fell face-first onto the floor beside his brother.

""I can't remember whether or not I lost consciousness ... but I remember the pain,"" Houle said.

Eventually, the officers asked Houle for his address and dropped them off at home. Neither man was charged.

Houle said he tried to file a complaint the next day, but police told him he needed the officers' names or badge numbers.

Over time they began to think what they experienced was normal, blaming themselves for what happened.

""Stuff like that happens,"" Joel said he thought at the time. ""What are you going to do?""

Over the ensuing years, the brothers struggled. Houle stopped going to university, eventually dropping out. Both brothers steered away from bars, enduring substance abuse that would last for years.

""This was one of the springboards that led both of us down a treacherous path,"" Houle said.

Eventually, both brothers got their lives back on track. Joel hardly drinks now, is a mechanic and has three kids.

Houle even thought about becoming a police officer, thinking he could effect change from within. In 2015, he joined the police chief's Indigenous advisory board.

That year he also filed an official complaint about the incident to the Professional Standards Branch, but the complaint was closed due to ""abandonment,"" even though Houle says he repeatedly tried contacting the officer in charge.

Last December he sought help from a lawyer and filed an official complaint with the police service.

The complaint, filed by Engel Law, details how Houle's experience in 2005 was part of a much larger problem within the Edmonton Police Service.

'Sweatboxes' and 'starlight' tours

In May 2005, three city police officers picked up nine Indigenous people on Whyte Avenue, holding them in the back of a police van equipped with six seats and dropping them off hours later in north Edmonton.

Though two officers, Const. Lael Sauter and Const. Patrick Hannas, were found guilty in 2010 of insubordination and discreditable conduct, the arbiter ruled that what had become known as the ""sweatbox"" case was not racially motivated.

At the time, advocate Lewis Cardinal wondered if it was a version of a ""starlight tour,"" a practice common in Saskatchewan where Indigenous men were picked up by police and dropped on the outskirts of town.

The case was just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""[There were] a lot of unreported incidents of police violence and aggression and brutality.

""We wanted to bring light to the issue at the time that this is something that really needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed deeply.""

Human rights advocate Lewis Cardinal was one of the leading activists criticizing police for their treatment of the nine Indigenous people picked up in the 'sweatbox' case. (CBC)

Cardinal said such incidents often went unreported because the victims had frequent run-ins with police — either due to their skin colour or to their socio-economic status — and feared retribution if they spoke out.

""There's a fear that's built into that,"" he said.

Cardinal has fought to expose police brutality and systemic racism within the EPS for decades.

He recalls an email widely shared among Edmonton police officers in 2005 titled ""Mr. Socko's Ten Principals [sic] of Downtown Policing"" which included transphobic, misogynist and racist language.

In the email, Const. Scott Carter wrote ""an Aboriginal is just an Indian,"" and that a police van unit, ""should always be referred to as the mobile Native Friendship Center [sic].""

""That email was something that really brought attention to that issue and particularly underlined the culture of racism within the police force,"" Cardinal said.

Around that same time, a downtown division police squad, known as C-2, was investigated after two former members alleged the squad was mistreating people experiencing homelessness in the inner city.

Following the investigation, the squad was dismantled.

'A long way to go'

Tom Engel, a longtime defence lawyer in Edmonton who often handles cases involving alleged police misconduct, was at the centre of most of these cases.

He said 2005 was a year when most of the issues activists had known about came to the surface.

""[The police] had a lot of problems and they were well aware of them,"" Engel said.

In an emailed statement, Edmonton police pointed to several of their initiatives, including their Indigenous engagement strategy, released in 2018.

They also said they work with an external consultant to review current practices and policies through the lens of reports like the Truth and Reconciliation 94 Calls to Action to improve their methods.

Engel said EPS has ""improved dramatically,"" but notes it ""has a long way to go to becoming a top-notch police service.""

Under the previous two chiefs of police — specifically under Chief Rod Knecht — punishment for officers found guilty of police misconduct increased to levels Engel said are more suitable for their actions.

It's led to fewer high-profile cases of police misconduct. However, the force is not yet without its faults.

""[Police officers] have to make it clear that they are not going to tolerate that kind of behaviour when they witness it,"" Engel said.

Despite all the incidents that Engel has seen, he's still optimistic.

""Things are only going to get better,"" he said.

Lewis Cardinal too remains optimistic.

""If I wasn't positive and hopeful for change, then what am I supposed to do, live in that constant fear and that negativity?""

Despite what Rob and Joel Houle experienced in 2005, they believe things can change.

Earlier this month, council voted to slash about three per cent of the estimated police budget in 2021, redirecting savings to support community development, housing and human services.

Houle said the cuts don't go nearly far enough, but still remains hopeful it's a start.

He says the renewed discussion around the role of police in the community is encouraging.

His brother Joel says while he doesn't trust police, a new role for them could be a way forward.

Both are family men with Joel just adding a third child to his family, matching Rob.

It's why they're sharing their stories, they said.

""My wife and my kids are kind of the reason that I do what I do,"" Rob Houle said. ""I [want] ... to be a better person and to make a better world for them.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/public-hearing-into-policing-in-edmonton-brings-back-painful-memories-for-cree-brothers-1.5652300?cmp=rss,news,canada,edmonton
24941,2020-07-20 9:00,Old Crow waiting to flip the switch on new solar array,"Building a solar farm 127 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle is a challenge; building an array of solar panels on permafrost in a remote community is a small engineering feat.

The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation in Old Crow, Yukon, is getting ready for phase one of a project that will see solar power running to the community's grid by the end of the summer.

ATCO Electric owns the diesel power grid run by diesel generators. It will buy the solar energy, feed it into the power grid, and redistribute it to the community. But the process has taken longer than expected because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""When it comes to the balancing of the different aspects of the microgrid to the battery, to the whole onset, it will take some time and this is a direct implication of the pandemic outbreak,"" said Dana Tizya-Tramm, chief of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation.

Tizya-Tramm said the pandemic has limited the number of contractors and experts they can draw on from across Canada and beyond, so they're going to complete the project over three phases.

The small community will have to wait for full phase three until next summer, when a Hercules aircraft will deliver the storage batteries.

""It's the size of a shipping container full of lithium-ion batteries — several Tesla roadsters worth of batteries,"" said Ben Power, vice president and co-founder of Whitehorse-based Solvest Inc., which installed the solar panel array.

When it's done, the solar panels are expected to reduce the community's reliance on diesel fuel by 189,000 litres a year, the First Nation said. Tizya-Tramm says once in operation the solar project could save the community as much as a quarter million dollars a year, by not having to use as much diesel fuel.

He says it's not cheap having to fly-in fuel to the community, which has no outside road system.

The project is jointly funded by several federal programs, the Canadian Northern Economic Agency, and the Yukon Development Corporation.

Adjustable feet for permafrost

The solar panels are configured in an east to west orientation to maximize the long summer days. Permafrost has been a problem since the beginning of the project.

""The movement and heaving with the solar panels project was something we had known about since the onset of the program,"" said Tizya-Tramm.

""This project has been engineered with this expectation, as it's one of the barriers we faced in construction 80 miles north of the Arctic Circle.""

He says there are height-adjustable feet built into the array with more than two feet of flexibility, and there will be adjustments made every year.

""Most of the changes and fluctuations in the permafrost are expected at the beginning of the project but it will settle over time.""

The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation says the solar project will be one of the largest generation projects across the Circumpolar North.

The First Nation will own and operate the solar project, in a 25-year purchase agreement with ATCO Electric and the Yukon Government.

24925,2020-07-20 8:54,"How COVID-19 has changed the way Canadians buy and sell homes, perhaps forever","Leave the doors open and all the lights on. That's one of the many new guidelines for people opening their homes — perhaps for the first time in months — so real estate agents can host open houses.

Some provinces are now allowing open houses, with new rules in place, after regulators clamped down on showings amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said earlier this month that open houses will resume, with warnings to potential house hunters. Visitors to open houses there can expect to see signs displaying health precautions, use hand-washing stations and sign a visitor log for contact tracing.

Ontario's Stage 3 reopening plan, which hit much of the province on Friday, also includes open houses under its new gathering limits of 50 people, or 30 per cent capacity, with physical distancing enforced.

Regina-based real estate agent Tim Otitoju says minimizing the need to touch doors and light switches is one of several ways the open house process has changed.

At showings, he is the one to open any front door — with gloves, sanitized hands and a mask — and he limits the number of people in the home at one time.

Before entering, potential home buyers and sellers answer questionnaires and sign waivers about any symptoms or exposure to COVID-19. Sellers who agree to the open house must sanitize the home.

The situation is all the trickier when landlords look to show properties occupied by tenants.

The Real Estate Council of Ontario has been discouraging unnecessary in-person private showings as well as open houses. But RECO doesn't have the power to require agents to get a tenant's consent.

""The imbalance of power that exists between landlord and tenant means renters are not always in a position to speak up and they should not be made to feel unsafe in their home,"" said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, in a statement from the Vancouver Tenants Union, opposing the return of open houses.

While open houses are once again an option in many areas, that doesn't mean every seller is on board, says Otitoju. Many still prefer to stick with virtual showings, and Otitoju himself opts for Zoom instead of in-person meetings for reviewing offers.

""I've got little shoe covers in the back of my care. My realtor tools have certainly changed,"" says Otitoju, an agent with Platinum Realty Specialists.

""I'm finding that this is working. Now, a lot of people coming out to open houses are in the market to buy that type of house. The time to go around to open houses as a hobby — it's not the time to do that right now. Buyers know that. Sellers know that. Realtors know that.""

It's all part of the changing sales process in real estate.

It might seem obvious that for a purchase as big as a house, no one wants to buy a sight unseen. But Anthony Hitt says even buyers of expensive properties are seeing the upsides of virtual tools that were popularized during the pandemic.

A tour where a seller or agent carries a camera around the house, for example, can allow buyers to look closely at finishes, views through windows and inside cabinets, says Hitt, president and CEO of Engel & Volkers Americas.

For sellers, it reassures them that those who end up at in-person showings are interested in buying, he says.

Cameron McNeill, who does marketing of pre-build properties in the Vancouver area with MLA Canada, says that although showrooms have been open for a month, people continue to do more research online before coming to in-person appointments.

More like car shopping

McNeill predicts that shopping for homes will become more like car shopping, where much of the research and emotional buying journey is done before hitting the lot.

""The most valuable thing you have is your time,"" says Hitt, saying that online tours cut down on travelling.

""I don't think we are going to eliminate open houses. We may see less of them and they may come at a different time in the process . . . . I don't think a lot of consumers, even with masks and all the precautions , are ready to run out and be in a crowded property.""

It used to be common to share a meal with a client, but that's not on Otitoju's mind these days, he says.

""I don't remember the last time I shook someone's hand,"" Otitoju says. ""It's not the only way to build relationships. You build relationships with your actions, and people see that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/real-estate-covid-19-1.5655844?cmp=rss,news,business,

24924,2020-07-20 8:36,U.K. to suspend extradition treaty with Hong Kong,"Britain's government says it will be making changes to its extradition treaty with Hong Kong on Monday, after China imposed a tough new national security law.

As tensions grow with Beijing, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has concerns about the new law and about alleged human rights abuses in China, particularly in regard to the treatment of the Uighur minority. He promised to be ""tough"" but to not completely abandon a policy of engagement with China.

""There is a balance here,"" Johnson said during a visit to a school. ""I'm not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China.""

Johnson says he will leave it to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to outline the extradition changes in a statement to the House of Commons later in the day.

Raab said Sunday it can no longer be ""business as usual."" He is reportedly planning to follow the example of the U.S., Australia and Canada by suspending extradition arrangements with the territory.

The review of the extradition measures comes only days after Britain backtracked on plans to give Chinese telecommunications company Huawei a role in the U.K.'s new high-speed mobile phone network amid security concerns fuelled by rising tensions between Beijing and Western powers.

China warns of 'interference'

Johnson's government has criticized China's decision to impose a sweeping new national security law on Hong Kong. The U.K. has accused the Beijing government of a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration under which the U.K. returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, and announced it would open a special route to citizenship for up to three million eligible residents of the community.

Beijing has objected to the move. China's ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, recently described the offer as ""gross interference"" in Chinese affairs.

Liu told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that Britain was ""dancing to the tune"" of the U.S. and rejected the allegations of human rights abuses against the mainly Muslim Uighur people.

He accused Western countries of trying to foment trouble with China.

""People say China [is] becoming very aggressive. That's totally wrong,"" Liu told the BBC. ""China has not changed. It's Western countries, headed by the United States — they started this so-called new cold war on China.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/uk-change-extradition-treaty-hong-kong-1.5655794?cmp=rss,news,world,

He's been the face of Jeopardy! since 1984, overseeing thousands of trivia contests since then and seeing a few legitimate stars born on the stage of the popular quiz show.

But Trebek's longtime fans will also remember his days with the CBC, when he hosted TV shows, covered sports and even read the news on air.

This week, the Sudbury, Ont.,-born quizmaster celebrates his 80th birthday and will mark the occasion with the release of his first memoir, The Answer Is...: Reflections on My Life, which comes out Tuesday, a day before Trebek's actual birthday.

Trebek says he hopes that through the book, his fans will get to know ""a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year.""

Trebek revealed last year that he had pancreatic cancer and received an outpouring of support from fans around the world who've been following his decades-long career.

He said he recently received a health update and that the news was good.

""I'm doing well,"" Trebek said in a video posted to social media last week. ""I'm continuing my treatment, and it is paying off.""

Unfortunately, though, the book makes no mention of the time CBC sent the future quiz show host on a skydiving assignment, according to a publicist with Simon and Schuster.

Curious fans will have to pester Trebek about that directly.

24942,2020-07-20 8:21,Back to Batoche Days to be held online this year,"This summer was supposed to be the big 50th anniversary celebrations of Back To Batoche Days.

The one-of-a-kind celebration of the Métis Nation's culture, traditions and heritage at Batoche, about an hour north of Saskatoon, brings people together from all across North America for a weekend of dancing, music, competitions and great food.

But the pandemic has altered those plans.

Instead, this year's Métis Nation – Saskatchewan's Back to Batoche is going to be a virtual event online from July 23-26.

""We're doing this virtually so we can stay connected to Back to Batoche Days and actually reach out across the land to all of our Métis citizens from B.C. to Ontario to some people in the United States who come and partake,"" Sherry McLennan, the Minister of Batoche, told Saskatchewan Weekend host Peter Mills.

Canadian Geographic is helping put together the virtual Back to Batoche event.

McLennan said the online experience will still include music, dance and education.

There are also competitions in jigging, fiddling and square dancing, where competitors can upload videos and compete.

Since 1970, the festival has been held annually at the national historic site commemorating the 1885 North-West Resistance and location of The Battle of Batoche.

McLennan said Batoche is very special.

""I have family that was originally raised on the Batoche land and I remember as a child going there and visiting all my family,"" she said.

""Now for me as a Métis leader, I did this for my grandparents because they taught me the Métis culture and they were a part of the Batoche.""

She said when you visit the site it is like going back in time.

""You have these big hills and it's like you can even imagine our people, our leaders and our Métis people fighting for us back in the day,"" she said.

She said today's celebrations are all about keeping Métis traditions, heroes and culture alive.

""It just brings back the feeling of respect and honouring of our elders who were a part of Batoche way back then,"" McLennan said.

""When you step on that Batoche land ... it's like you can feel the music, you can feel the people, you know stomping their feet and clapping their hands and you know everybody's is just having fun and being a part of a family, a big huge family of Métis people.""

McLennan said areas like the veterans war memorial site is very important for the Métis people.

24990,2020-07-20 8:00,B.C. warned of potential for 'explosive growth' as 102 new COVID-19 cases announced over weekend,"B.C.'s overall death rate among confirmed COVID-19 patients is six per cent, but that percentage spikes dramatically among those infected in long-term care homes and hospitals, according to new statistics.

On Monday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry presented the latest numbers on the toll the novel coronavirus has taken in British Columbia.

That includes a big spike in new infections over the weekend, with 102 new confirmed cases since Friday afternoon. There have now been 3,300 cases in B.C. since the beginning of the pandemic, of which 253 are still active.

The latest modelling suggests that the numbers of new cases reported daily are rising and could continue to rise over the summer.

""We do have the possibility of having explosive growth here in our outbreak, if we're not careful,"" Henry said.

She said that while B.C. has done a good job at flattening the curve of infection so far, the province is currently ""on the edge"" and could see that work undone in the coming weeks.

Sixteen people are now in hospital, including four in intensive care. There have been no new deaths recorded since Friday, leaving B.C.'s total at 189 to date.

Statistics presented Monday show that 20 per cent of COVID-19 patients in long-term care and 22 per cent in acute care units of hospitals have died of their illness. The death rate drops dramatically to 0.5 per cent in the remaining COVID-19 patients.

As British Columbians expand their social circles and more businesses open up in Phase 3 of the province's pandemic response, the new modelling suggests that each new infection is generating an increasing number of additional infections.

In April and May, when the strictest measures were in place, each new COVID-19 patient infected less than one other person. That measure has now risen to more than one new infection from each patient.

The modelling suggests that everyone needs to be cautious about how many other people they are interacting with — if the average person's number of contacts increases to 70 or 80 per cent of normal, the number of infections could increase dramatically.

Right now, the average person's contacts are at about 65 to 70 per cent of normal, which Henry described as concerning.

""We run the risk of rapid rise,"" she said.

Serology tests suggest that fewer than one in 100 people in B.C. have been infected to date, which means the vast majority are still susceptible to infection.

60 cases now connected to Kelowna exposures

Henry said she's particularly concerned about the number of new cases that appear to have resulted from parties and larger public gatherings.

That includes 60 cases that have now been linked to multiple exposure events in Kelowna at downtown and waterfront bars and private gatherings in the time around the Canada Day long weekend. Most new cases confirmed this weekend were people in their 20s and 30s, according to Henry.

""We are starting to see people who are testing positive in the last few days having a large number of contacts again,"" she said.

""We are no longer having safe interactions.""

Mental health and financial burdens for young people

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix also presented results from an online survey completed by 394,382 people about the impact of COVID-19.

The results suggest that most people have followed the public health advice to wash hands regularly and avoid gatherings, but staying home when sick is still a bit of a sticking point. While 79 per cent of those who responded said they can stay home when they're feeling unwell, only about 67 per cent said they actually stay home.

The biggest problems caused by COVID-19, according to those who answered the survey, include loss of work, concern for vulnerable family members and mental health struggles.

Those between the ages of 18 and 29 were most likely to say their mental health and financial situation have suffered as a result of the pandemic.

Impromptu update

Monday's briefing is the first since Henry called an unplanned news conference Friday to announce 28 new cases of the virus, including a baby in neonatal intensive care.

She urged residents to enjoy the summer with care.

Meanwhile, Vancouver Coastal Health authorities are looking at how COVID-19 spread in the neo-natal intensive care unit at St. Paul's Hospital, where the baby tested positive for the virus.

Henry said fewer than 10 people were exposed, and the baby was not showing signs of illness. Health-care workers were also exposed, but she said she didn't know how many were involved.

The infants who were exposed at St. Paul's are isolating with their families, according to Henry.

Also on Friday an alert was issued for potential exposure to COVID-19 at the Sandman hotel on Davie Street in Vancouver between July 7 and July 16.

Another case was discovered in a worker from Alberta at the Site C dam project and a list of potential exposures on flights coming and going from B.C. continues to expand.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-covid-update-july-20-1.5655625?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia

Owned by ByteDance, TikTok opened an office in Australia in recent weeks. Offices of both the Home Affairs and Attorney General are discussing TikTok's operations, the sources said.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was ""having a good look"" at TikTok, which has also fallen under U.S. scrutiny for ""national security risks.""

""If we consider there is a need to take further action than we are taking now, then I can tell you we won't be shy about it,"" Morrison told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday.

'Inconsistent with Australian values': senator

Separately, Labor Sen. Jenny McAllister, the chairwoman of a parliamentary inquiry into foreign interference through social media, has identified TikTok as needing further scrutiny, noting 1.6 million young Australians used the app.

""Some of these approaches to moderating content might be inconsistent with Australian values,"" she told ABC radio.

""For example, removing material about Tiananmen Square, or deprioritizing material about Hong Kong protests.""

How close are we to a vaccine for COVID-19?

Top Republicans in Congress are expected to meet Monday with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on the next COVID-19 aid package as the crisis many hoped would have improved has dramatically worsened, just as emergency relief is expiring.

New divisions between the Senate GOP majority and the White House posed fresh challenges. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was prepared to roll out the $1 trillion US package in a matter of days. But the administration panned more virus testing money and interjected other priorities that could complicate quick passage.

Lawmakers were returning to a Capitol still off-limits to tourists, another sign of the nation's difficulty containing the coronavirus. Rather than easing, the pandemic's devastating cycle is happening all over again, leaving Congress little choice but to engineer another costly rescue. Businesses are shutting down again, schools cannot fully reopen and jobs are disappearing, all while federal aid expired.

More than 3.6 million people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the U.S. and 140,000 have died. Daily growth in cases has tripled to more than 70,000 since mid-May, and the seven-day moving average of deaths, after falling steadily from April to July, has turned higher.

Without a successful federal strategy coming from the White House, lawmakers are trying to draft one.

""It's not going to magically disappear,"" said a sombre McConnell last week during a visit to a hospital in his home state of Kentucky to thank front-line workers.

WATCH | Trump, Chris Wallace spar over COVID-19 mortality rate:

McConnell and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy were set to meet with Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ""to fine-tune"" the legislation, acting chief of staff Mark Meadows said on Fox News.

The political stakes are high for all sides before the November election, but even more so for the nation, which has registered more coronavirus infections and a higher death count than any other country.

Just as the pandemic's ferocious cycle is starting again, the first round of aid is running out.

A federal $600-a-week boost to regular unemployment benefits expires at the end of the month. So, too, does a federal ban on evictions on millions of rental units.

With 17 straight weeks of unemployment claims topping one million, many households were facing a cash crunch and losing employer-backed health insurance coverage.

The latest package from McConnell has been quietly crafted behind closed doors for weeks and was expected to include $75 billion US to help schools reopen, reduced unemployment benefits alongside a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.

But as the White House weighed in, the administration was panning some $25 billion in proposed new funds for testing and tracing, said one Republican familiar with the discussions. The administration's objections were first reported by The Washington Post.

The new push from the White House put the administration at odds with Republican allies in Congress, a disconnect that threatened to upend an already difficult legislative process. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already passed Democrats' vast $3 trillion US proposal, and virus cases and deaths have only increased since.

Senate Democrats were investigating why the Trump administration had not yet spent some of the $25 billion previously allocated for testing in an earlier aid bill.

As McConnell prepared to roll out his $1 trillion-plus proposal, he acknowledged it would not have full support. This would be the fifth virus aid package, after the $2.2 trillion US bill passed in March, the largest U.S. intervention of its kind.

Meanwhile, school districts around the U.S. are facing a dilemma. With the number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths still rising, districts must grapple with whether to bring students back to classrooms, and how to keep pupils and teachers safe if they do.

The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest public school system behind New York City, announced last week that all classes will be conducted virtually when they resume next month.

Administrators in the Parkway school district in suburban St. Louis spent the summer break crafting a flexible reopening plan, with options that include full-time classroom learning, full-time online instruction and a hybrid system.

But even with the fall semester set to begin in five weeks, the dangers of the coronavirus are so uncertain that district officials are reluctant to make predictions about how classes will proceed.

""If you had asked me even two weeks ago, 'Do you think we would be able to come back?' I would have said, 'Yeah,""' assistant superintendent Kevin Beckner said. ""Today my answer is, 'I'm not sure,' just because of how the situation has changed so quickly.""

The Parkway district on Monday is scheduled to announce its plans for the fall, but it will stay ready to pivot quickly if the spread worsens or the outlook improves, Beckner said.

Signs will encourage physical distancing, and desks will be spaced farther apart. Face coverings will be required for all students, instructors and staff. Some teachers will wear masks with clear coverings so students who are deaf or hard of hearing can follow what they are saying.

Times will be scheduled for handwashing and using hand sanitizer. Plexiglas will separate librarians, office staff and teachers interacting one-on-one with students. A nurse will perform contact tracing on confirmed cases.

What's happening with coronavirus in Canada

As of 7 a.m. ET on Monday, Canada had 110,340 coronavirus infections. Provinces and territories listed 97,051 of those as recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,882.

The House of Commons will meet Monday to debate legislation on extending the emergency wage subsidy and providing one-time payments to Canadians with disabilities struggling during the pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has proposed changes to the federal emergency wage subsidy that would see the program extended until the end of the year and expand eligibility for more businesses.

Under his proposal, businesses would no longer need to show that their revenues had dropped by at least 30 per cent in order to qualify — and would receive a subsidy that varies based on how much revenue they lost.

The legislation also includes a new one-time payment aimed at helping Canadians with disabilities cover costs associated with the pandemic. Those payments were part of a bill that failed to move through the Commons in June after opposition parties did not provide the unanimous consent required to debate it.

What's happening in the rest of the world

In Europe, where infections are far below their peak but local outbreaks are causing concern, signs emerged that leaders of northern European Union countries were willing to compromise on a 1.8 trillion euro ($2.8 trillion Cdn) coronavirus stimulus plan on Monday as talks in Brussels extended to a fourth day.

Old grievances between countries less affected by the pandemic and those that have been indebted in recent years, like Italy and Spain, have materialized. Countries such as the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark have preferred more funds be allocated through loans than through grants.

""An agreement is a necessity,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told French BFM TV on Monday, as weary diplomats slept or prepared for another day in what could be the longest-ever EU summit.

The leaders were set to resume talks later Monday morning.

In Britain, officials said they have signed a deal to buy 90 million doses of experimental coronavirus vaccines being developed by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and others.

The British government said in a statement Monday that it had secured access to a vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, in addition to another experimental vaccine researched by Valneva. Britain had previously signed a deal with AstraZeneca to provide 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine being tested by Oxford University, which is expected to announce further results later Monday.

""Millions of people could be vaccinated against coronavirus,"" the government statement said, citing the three different vaccines it has now invested in.

Although it is still unclear which if any of the vaccines will ultimately prove effective against the virus, Britain and other rich countries are already investing in the vaccines to ensure there is enough manufacturing capacity to deliver any successful candidate. Vaccines typically take years to develop and more than a dozen are in the early stages of testing globally.

A surge in coronavirus cases in the second-biggest city in Australia could take weeks to subside despite a lockdown and orders to wear masks, the country's acting chief medical officer said on Monday.

Authorities in the state of Victoria, whose capital Melbourne is in partial lockdown amid a new outbreak, reported 275 new cases on Monday, down from a daily record of 438 three days earlier.

""We have learned over time that the time between introducing a measure and seeing its effect is at least two weeks and sometimes longer than that,"" acting chief medical officer Paul Kelly told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.

Australia has recorded about 11,800 coronavirus cases with a death toll of 123, a fraction of what has been seen in other countries. In most Australian states the disease has been effectively eliminated.

Less than a month ago, Australia was widely heralded as a global leader in combating COVID-19, but quarantine lapses in Victoria triggered a flare-up in infections in June.

Victoria's government has ordered about five million people into a partial lockdown for six weeks and told residents around Melbourne to cover their faces if they have to leave their homes.

Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said it was too soon to declare that such measures had flattened the outbreak.

""Until we bring some stability to this, we won't be able to talk about a trend,"" he said, referring to the drop in daily new cases.

24939,2020-07-20 7:00,Former RCMP officers reflect on how to fix policing in the North,"Since the RCMP's earliest days, it has relied on Indigenous people for survival.

In the North, Canada's project of extending sovereignty over vast northern territories was made possible by the work of the RCMP and its Indigenous ""special constables,"" who acted as guides and interpreters.

""Our special constables … turned a lot of those RCMP members into men,"" said Gerry Kisoun, who joined the RCMP in 1971 as one of the last special constables, and served as a regular officer for more than 20 years.

But that shared history has not resulted in better treatment of Indigenous people.

In the North, critics say, members run out the clock on two-year stints isolated from the communities they serve, policing according to a model that has resulted in a large number of Indigenous people dying at their hands .

Increasingly, top officials, from the RCMP's commissioner to the prime minister , are recognizing the systemic racism that pervades the force.

Now, in the light of nationwide protests for police reform and abolition, pressure is mounting on the RCMP to devolve community safety to Indigenous communities, and reckon with their troubled history in the North.

""The policing [model] in the RCMP and the policing model in our Indigenous communities are diametrically opposed,"" said Gina Nagano, a Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in First Nation member who served with the RCMP from 1985 to 2006.

""Indigenous communities across Canada are waking up and saying ... 'We have a choice, and we're going to push back.""

Complicated legacy

In the North, the RCMP has been both a source of pride and an agent of oppression.

As a child, Kisoun remembers hearing stories of RCMP officers' daring exploits on the land of the Mackenzie Delta, enabled by the work of the Indigenous guides who inspired him to first join the force. But he remembers darker stories too.

""Some of the other stories we heard was, you gotta listen to what the RCMP say, because they'll come into your house and scare the living daylights out of you,"" he said. ""That if you don't send your kids to school, the RCMP are going to come along and throw you in jail.""

Both Kisoun and Nagano said their own experience with the RCMP, growing up, was largely positive. RCMP officers were either locals, or well-integrated into the community, they said.

""We had great police officers in Dawson City that were posted there, and always participated in community events,"" said Nagano. ""They were great role models.""

I never really saw discrimination ... until I joined the RCMP. - Gina Nagano, former RCMP officer

But the view from inside the force was quite different.

""I grew up in a community where most of my friends were non-[Indigenous],"" she said, ""and I never really saw discrimination … until I joined the RCMP.""

""I was surprised to see it internally, and to have it that prevalent.""

Nagano's experience was not unique. Margorie Hudson, an Ojibwe officer from Manitoba, has launched a class-action suit against the RCMP , alleging 31 years of discrimination by her colleagues.

Kisoun acknowledged he too experienced discrimination while on the job, but said ""right now, that's neither here nor there.""

But he did say the organization's history is a factor in the routine mistreatment of Indigenous officers and civilians.

""We're Indigenous, and we're going into something that was brought in by the Europeans,"" said Kisoun. ""And sometimes, it's not an easy transition to go from where we are, to where they are.

""It takes a lot of work.""

RCMP disconnected from communities

Both Kisoun and Nagano said that work is not any easier today, as the force has grown more disconnected from the northern communities it serves.

""The posting is two years,"" said Nagano. ""It makes it really challenging for the RCMP officer to want to step out again and engage with the community.""

""But vice-versa is, the citizens are seeing that all the time,"" she said. ""They're seeing the change [and] inconsistency.""

That affects trust, she said, and forces officers into ""reactive policing"" — the kind of work where violent incidents are more common.

""If you break those barriers down, become part of the community, get to know the citizens…. everything becomes proactive … because the community wants to work with you.""

Kisoun said it's not enough to have better community engagement — at the end of the day, more northerners need to join the ranks.

""We have to have our own people involved as well,"" said Kisoun. ""We have to see them out in those RCMP cruisers, doing the work in the community, keeping the peace.""

Given several days, none of the northern RCMP detachments provided statistics on how many Indigenous people they employed.

What local control looks like

To Nagano, the solution lies outside the RCMP. After leaving the force in 2006, she worked to establish Indigenous-run community safety programs at the Kwanlin Dün and Selkirk First Nations in Yukon.

The programs employ local First Nation members to conduct patrols and intervene in situations where police would normally be called. She said it made a big difference to interactions with police.

""Most of the time, when the community safety officers engaged with … an individual, they knew who they were ahead of time,"" she explained. ""They knew what family they belonged to, what clan they belonged to, and they had the ... understanding to approach it differently.""

Who better to police the community than … the citizens themselves? - Gina Nagano

If someone requires intervention, she said, ""we don't go to the probation officers. We go to grandma. We go to that elder in the community that will make that person accountable for their actions.""

""It's not just a model for First Nations communities, it's a model that can work in any community. Who better to police the community than … the citizens themselves?""

Nagano has a vision for rolling out this model across the country, but the barrier is a familiar one — funding, and a lack of ""political will"" to make it happen.

""I think they see it as a threat,"" said Nagano. ""They have already had something for 100 years…. It's a challenge for them to see someone coming in with an alternative.""

For his part, Kisoun is not holding his breath.

""There's lots of talk in regards to self-government … and having your own policing,"" said Kisoun, ""but that might take some time.""

""As far as I'm concerned,"" he said, ""I think that the RCMP will be here for a long, long, long time.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/indigenous-rcmp-policing-north-1.5654513?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
24956,2020-07-20 6:42,"As courts use new technology during COVID-19, some clients are being left behind, lawyers warn","The pandemic has propelled Ontario's justice system into the 21st century, with video and audio conference calls, email exchanges and electronic documents replacing many antiquated systems.

While many applaud the courts' move away from in-person hearings and paper filing, others warn that the newer technology is a double-edged sword that is likely to negatively impact people with low incomes who don't have access to reliable internet or phone minutes.

""We're all doing the best that we can right now, but my main concern is that eventually someone will say, 'This phone thing hasn't been going so badly, all you need is a cell phone, let's hold all hearings this way,'"" said Jamie Hildebrand, executive director of the Huron-Perth Community Legal Clinic, which helps low-income residents with legal help, including many disputes before the Landlord Tenant Board.

""There are people who don't have access to basic technology and we can't assume that they do,"" Hildebrand said. ""No one believes that someone doesn't have a phone, but it happens.""

On a payphone, in the rain

Lawyers in all parts of the justice system, from tribunals to family and criminal law, admit there are cases where new technology has helped their clients, but also times where it's been a hindrance to justice.

For example, Hildebrand recently listened in on a hearing during which a person was being evicted.

""This gentleman has some emotional and psychological issues where he doesn't have a cell phone. It's difficult for him to navigate using it, he's very suspicious, he has privacy concerns, so he has a mistrust of cell phones,"" said Hildebrand, who was there to offer legal advice if needed.

The client ended up calling into the hearing from a phone booth, with trucks whizzing by, in the rain. He was whimpering, soaking wet and ended up hanging up the phone.

Phone booths have become important for people who need to deal with court matters but don't have access to a cell phone or internet. (Shutterstock / Kiev.Victor)

""Here's a guy standing outside at a payphone, there are people walking by and he's basically pleading, in his mind at least, for a place to live. He's begging for his life. How humiliating and frustrating and aggravating,"" Hildebrand said. ""We have to recognize that there are people who don't have the most basic technology that we presume.""

For other clients, newer technology has been beneficial, lawyers said, but using it takes a lot of planning.

Duty counsel lawyers, for example, are available to provide legal advice about what will happen at a court appearance and what rights a person has. They often look at people's paperwork to see what solution might be useful, but that can't happen over the phone, unless someone has kept a lot of documentation and is willing to read it to a lawyer over the phone.

Video and audio hearings have been especially problematic in family court, where at least half of those people involved are self-represented.

""For my clients, at least they have a lawyer that has the technology if they don't, but the self-represented parties are a big concern for the court system right now,"" said Bayly Guslits, a family law lawyer at Harrison Pensa in London, Ont., who handles a lot of legal aid clients.

Self-represented parties don't have a handle on all of the new technology, don't know how to navigate the legal system and need to be informed along the way about what is happening, often by lawyers working for the opposing side.

Pre-planning is key

In London, everything but the most urgent cases were postponed during the early stages of the pandemic. Those emergency motions were handled by teleconference until two weeks ago, when Ontario started allowing video calls.

""You don't get to see the person, you don't get to see the judge and you do lose something without being able to read the facial expressions and make eye contact,"" Guslits said. ""I did have at least one conference call where we had to go ahead because no one could reach one of the parties, and you just don't know whether they're going to be participating or not.""

WATCH | Pandemic-related court delays could led to criminal cases being thrown out:

The COVID-19 pandemic halted Canada's already clogged court system, and those delays could see criminal cases thrown out, because a Supreme Court ruling set time limits for trials. 2:05

Another time, a self-represented person tried to call in for 45 minutes and couldn't connect.

""The judge allowed us to wait it out, told him to get to a payphone and he ended up participating from a payphone,"" Guslits said. ""We were fortunate in that situation because it was the only thing on the judge's docket that day. When the courts are fully reopened and they're scheduling 10, 20 cases in a day, I don't think there will be that kind of flexibility.""

Spotty Wi-Fi connections in rural areas have also led to problems with video-conferencing, she said.

""I think it requires some advance planning, lawyers getting in touch with clients ahead of time, making sure that the technology works,"" Guslits said. ""You have to make sure people have access to a phone, whether it's a payphone or a friend's or family member's phone.""

'We work off non-verbal cues a lot'

The technology has allowed clients to participate in court appearances or conferences without having to find child care or figure out how to get to the courthouse, lawyers said.

That's especially true in criminal court, where in the past, accused people or their lawyers had to appear in court every few weeks to check in, even if their appearance was only going to last a few minutes.

""Everything in criminal court is being done by audio right now, and there have been some challenges — for example, having private conversations with your client,"" said Katie Heathcote, a criminal defence lawyer in London, Ont.

""When you're in the same room and your client needs a clarification, you can just address that, but right now, everyone has to hang up, then we re-dial and talk privately, and then dial back in.""

Heathcote said that so far, ""everyone has been pretty accommodating, with some judges making it a habit to tell people, 'If you need a private conversation with your counsel, please feel free to interrupt the proceedings.'""

Still, she said it has been strange to question witnesses during bail hearings by audio, because you can't see their demeanour.

""We work off non-verbal cues a lot, so credibility assessments for the court can be a challenge,"" Heathcote said.

She said that clients who in the past may not have had the resources to make it back and forth to court are happier with teleconferencing.

""Overall, clients are satisfied, but we're not dealing with complex matters right now, nothing that involves possible jail time.""

Verifying ID tricky right now

Heathcote said she had one client who was couch surfing or homeless whose social worker ended up helping him get to a phone at the appropriate time.

""It requires sometimes a little bit more legwork on our end,"" she said. ""We've got to put all the pieces together and ensure that our client is going to be ready to go on that [court] date.""

Getting identification to court staff or for a police background check can also be a challenge at the moment, Heathcote said.

If someone wants to be a surety for an accused person, for example, they're asked to take a close-up picture of their ID, then take a selfie with the ID next to their face.

""That way, the police can ensure they've got the right person when they conduct the background check,"" Heathcote said.

She said holding simple adjournments by audio or video should continue, but won't likely replace in-person court appearances. Hildebrand agrees.

""We need to keep in-person hearings,"" he said. ""It's a fundamental fact of human interaction. We can't replace human relationships with a telephone or a Zoom call. Those are virtual attempts that, in my opinion, don't replace the millions of years we've had of evolution producing the way we relate to each other.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/ontario-court-technology-1.5655619?cmp=rss,news,canada,london

The girls, aged 11 and six, were previously the subject of an Amber Alert. Investigators had reason to believe they were abducted by their father, Martin Carpentier, who remains missing.

The private viewing and ceremony is being held at Complexe Funéraire ​​Claude Marcoux in Saint-Romuald, Que., south of Quebec City.

The public will be allowed to pay their respects between noon and 3 p.m.

Due to gathering restrictions, a maximum of 50 people will be allowed to attend the memorial and everyone will be required to wear masks.

A large screen will be installed in the parking lot behind the funeral home for friends and family who can't fit inside.

Search continues for missing father

After 10 days of combing through the forests around Saint-Apollinaire, the Sûreté du Québec has shifted focus in its ongoing search for the 44-year-old Carpentier.

Police have been looking for Carpentier since he disappeared with his two daughters on July 8.

The bodies of the two girls were found by police following a three-day search. Police have not released details about the causes of their deaths.

24902,2020-07-20 5:30,'I will be a little bit more at peace': Natan Obed reflects on report of CFL team changing name,"Natan Obed doesn't feel he made the Edmonton football team change its name.

But the national Inuit leader — whose 2015 op-ed in The Globe and Mail brought the discussion into the national spotlight ahead of the team's Grey Cup victory — says if the reports are to be believed, Inuit can now move on to tackling other issues without this ""distraction.""

CBC News has not been able to verify the reports from TSN and Postmedia suggesting Edmonton's CFL club has come to an internal decision to change its name, with an announcement expected as early as this week.

A team spokesperson said, as of Saturday, there was no update regarding the name change.

But if the reports are true, it brings an end to a bitterly divisive debate which has played out not only in Southern Canada, but among Inuit across the country.

""That's something that weighs heavily on me because I hate to see our community and our people fight with one another over any issues. But let alone something that seems to be so personal,"" Obed, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), told CBC News.

Repairing relationships

Support and opposition for the team's name across Inuit Nunangat largely depended on demographics. Inuit in the Western Arctic were generally more supportive of the name, along with older Inuit; while those further East, and the younger generations, predominantly supported a change.

In the fight for Inuit self-determination, we all want to feel like we're part of it - Natan Obed , President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami

Duane Smith, the chair of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation — and an ITK board member — told Sportsnet radio earlier this month many of his constituents found pride in Edmonton's team name.

The issue even reached Nunavut's Legislative Assembly in February, where cabinet minister Lorne Kusugak told naysayers to ""take a Valium"" during his member's statement.

Obed acknowledged there will be some who are upset with him over the reported outcome, comparing it to former Nunavut MP Nancy Karetak Lindell's voting in favour of same-sex marriage legislation, despite strong opposition from her constituents at the time.

""When the name changes, I will be a little bit more at peace and I hopefully will be able to now start repairing some of these relationships that have been broken through this discourse,"" Obed said, adding the issue for him was never over what Inuit think of the term, but rather about a business using it as a moniker.

""It was never about just blatantly criticizing and ridiculing anyone. This was about social justice. It is about systemic racism. And it is really about Inuit self-determination.

""I think that in the fight for Inuit self-determination, we all want to feel like we're part of it.""

Other issues to focus on

During a phone-in show on CBC Nunavut's Tausunni radio program on Friday, one caller suggested there are more important issues facing Inuit than a football team's name.

Indeed, Obed agreed. But said this issue was important, too.

""Systemic racism has all sorts of different ways that it presents itself to Inuit,"" he said.

""And by this name being replaced, it ends one of those avenues for systemic racism to exist. And that to me is just so heartening in the face of so many other things that Inuit face every day.""

Obed also said this issue proved Inuit have a voice for change in this country.

""The fact that this name can change I think also shows that when we mobilize and when we use our voices and we stand up for things that we do right,"" he said.

""And it'll be hard. And our own community may not be with us at all steps along the way. But we're doing things that matter for Inuit, and for all Inuit coming in the future.""

Ending the use of the term in non-Inuit discourse

Asked if this (reported) decision from the CFL team is the turning point for non-Inuit to stop using the term altogether in social discourse, Obed said ""Yes.""

""That is a huge victory for Inuit and for Inuit self-determination,"" he said.

""If Inuit within our communities want to use that term to describe themselves or describe their friends, or use the term, that is the pure discretion of Inuit and Inuit alone.

""I don't want my children being called [that term] by government, or by anyone that they interact with. And this decision by the Edmonton football team will make sure that it is not socially acceptable anywhere, for any non-Inuit, to use that term for any reason to describe us.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/edmonton-football-team-name-change-natan-obed-1.5654989?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
24898,2020-07-20 5:00,Black with a capital 'B': Why it took news outlets so long to make 1 change that matters to so many,"One after the other, a number of news organizations across Canada and the United States announced in June the same change in their language guidelines: to capitalize the word ""Black"" when referring to Black people and culture.

The Globe and Mail made its announcement on June 3, followed by the CBC on June 8 and The Canadian Press the next day.

In the U.S., a number of news organizations, including the Los Angeles Times, NBC, The Associated Press and the New York Times, also announced the same change to their style guides.

The announcements by so many news organizations coincided with the massive Black Lives Matter protests across the United States and Canada that have led to widespread reflection about the impact of racism across society, including in policing, the justice system, education, politics and the press.

Activists and journalists of colour have been calling on news organizations to change the way they write about and report on Black communities for years, but it was the groundswell of protest in the wake of the killing of George Floyd that prompted change. (Yuki Iwamura/The Associated Press)

Journalism style guides are, by nature, rigid and slow to change, purposefully upholding established rules and conventions. But many activists, academics and journalists of colour say the language used by the news media to describe diverse communities is particularly slow to catch up because there's a lack of diverse voices in news organizations responsible for making such decisions.

Slow change

In 1930, American activist W.E.B. Du Bois was successful in getting the New York Times to start writing the word ""Negro"" with a capital N.

He had been campaigning for the change since the 1920s. He called the use of a ""small letter for the name of 12 million Americans and 200 million human beings a personal insult.""

Many Black people have been writing Black with a capital ""B"" since the 1960s, inspired by the Black Power movement started by civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael.

There have been calls for publications to follow suit for the past two decades.

The police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement not only in the U.S. but in more than 60 countries worldwide, including here in Canada.

A copy of the 17th edition of The Canadian Press Stylebook. The Canadian Press and a number of other news outlets in Canada and the U.S. recently changed their style and now capitalize the word 'Black' when referring to Black people and culture. (Kashmala Fida)

Newsrooms across North America are now taking a hard look at themselves, as journalists of colour, particularly Black journalists, point out the many ways in which news organizations have let them down.

And one of those ways has been through language.

Spelling ""Black"" with a capital ""B"" has been a common practice of publications that focus on the Black community, such as Essence and Ebony magazines, for example, for more than a decade. It is also offered as an option by Oxford and Merriam-Webster dictionaries.

Black writers and activists have long petitioned for the change in news copy.

James McCarten, stylebook editor at The Canadian Press, the authoritative guide for Canadian news writing and editing, said although the guide is the standard that news media follow, it does not set the course for changes in language.

""It does not chart the path; it follows the path that the users of the language are blazing,"" he said.

The Canadian Press prefers not to rush into making changes to its style guide, he said, ""for the simple reason that constantly changing a style essentially means you don't have a style.""

He said The Canadian Press had to wait and see if ""Black"" with a capital ""B"" was consistently used before revising its rule.

""When you make a change, you can't have to go back on it. You have to be sure that this is where the language is going to go, this is where the usage is going to go.""

At the CBC, the style guide says the lowercased version was based on a longstanding convention of using lowercase letters for ""racial, ethnic and nationality labels not directly rooted in proper nouns. (e.g., African, European and Latino, but 'black,' 'white' and 'brown').""

The rationale to make the change was to ""respect frequently voiced preferences of Black people"" and ""reflect increasingly common usage in Canada,"" according to standards editor Blair Shewchuk.

The Globe and Mail gave a similar explanation in its public statement.

Lack of representation

Handel Wright, director of the University of British Columbia's Centre for Culture, Identity and Education in Vancouver, said it helps if newsrooms listen to communities on how they would like to be represented, but it is even more important that members of those communities are actually part of newsrooms.

""Part of what needs to happen is that the media need to be more representative of the group that they're speaking about. So ... who is reporting about different groups makes a difference,"" he said.

""I think it is reflective of the fact that maybe the media itself is not diverse enough that the media is always playing the catch-up game.""

The 2016 Canadian census found nearly a quarter of citizens identified as Black, Indigenous or a person of colour (BIPOC).

CBC/Radio-Canada tracks the diversity of its workforce with a voluntary survey. As of 2019, visible minorities made up 16.5 per cent of the workforce in English services and 6.5 per cent of the workforce in French services. Indigenous staff accounted for 3.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively. Among CBC/Radio-Canada executives, 4.1 per cent were visible minorities, and none were Indigenous.

The Globe and Mail did a voluntary survey in 2018 in which 60 per cent of staff participated. The results showed that 23 per cent of staff identified as visible minorities.

Maclean's and the Toronto Star both changed their style to ""Black"" with a capital ""B"" before other Canadian outlets after columnists of colour in their newsrooms called for the change.

When Maclean's did so in 2015, it was because of contributing editor Andray Domise.

Andray Domise, a contributing editor and columnist at Maclean's magazine, is critical of how the news media covered the early protests that followed the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. (Andray Domise for Toronto City Council - Ward 2/Facebook)

Although glad to see the change, Domise nonetheless questions why it took Maclean's so long to make it.

""Why wasn't it a standard before I got there?"" he said.

As for the outlets who made the same change last month, he questions the motives behind it.

""Why not before? What changed? What was the difference between then and now?"" he said.

""Personally, I don't think anything has changed except that we are seeing an uprising happening. To me, it's almost an esthetic means of placating the masses, rather than engaging in substance of change.""

Anthony Collins, style chief for the Toronto Star, said the newspaper changed its spelling of ""Black"" in 2017 because Shree Paradkar, the paper's race and gender columnist, explained why it was necessary.

He acknowledged that a lack of newsroom diversity helps explain why outlets are slow to respond to language changes that communities want to see in the media.

""I think there's often a lot of uncertainty about what term to use and a lot of nervousness around using the wrong term, which, frankly, I think just comes from having a newsroom that's not as diverse as it should be,"" he said.

""I think the Star, you know, has a broad readership, and we serve a very diverse community. And I think if a community doesn't see itself reflected in our stories, or misrepresented somehow, I think that's incredibly injurious to public trust in our journalism.""

Describing communities appropriately

Despite the change to the word ""Black"" and other style guide adjustments, journalists of colour and activists agree that news organizations and journalists still have a long way to go when it comes to using the appropriate language to describe Indigenous and Black people and people of colour.

Another relatively recent language change at news organizations such as CBC, the Toronto Star and The Canadian Press includes encouraging journalists to specify, if possible, what Indigenous nation a person belongs to instead of just referring to them generically as Indigenous.

But Rachel Decoste, a community activist in Ottawa who had been advocating for the CBC to change its guideline on the word ""Black"" for years, says more changes are needed.

She also wants newsrooms to use the term ""enslaved Africans"" instead of ""slaves"" when discussing slavery. The change started in academic circles as a way to describe enslaved individuals as people first, commodities second.

""Now that we are writing 'Black' with a capital 'B,' perhaps our ancestors could also get the respect that they deserve,"" Decoste said.

Beyond style guides

And although style and language guides might change, there are many other factors that go into telling a story.

For example, some of the early coverage of the Black Lives Matter protests in American and Canadian media was criticized for mirroring the language used in reporting on the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s, particularly in the way violence was often attributed to protesters rather than police.

Domise said some of the reporting following the killing of Floyd was quick to describe the protests as ""violent"" as soon as property damage was involved.

""No, the violence was already pre-existing,"" he said of this type of coverage.

""The violence was what precipitated the protest in the first place. A police officer suffocated somebody to death in the middle of the street. You can see the anti-Blackness seeping out of the narrative.

""I was alive in the early 2000s, in the 1990s and 1980s, and nothing has changed in terms of the way the media writes about Black people. So, how far have we come along? We haven't.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/capitalizing-black-style-1.5626669?cmp=rss,news,canada,edmonton
24900,2020-07-20 4:10,Mé​​​​​​​tis artist creates 'wash your hands' posters in 21 Indigenous languages,"When Colleen Gray saw that the United Nations had put out a call for artists to join the fight against COVID-19, her first thought was how to get the message out to Canada's Indigenous communities.

The Métis artist decided to take two of her pieces and, using translations she found on an Indigenous Services Canada website, add the recommendation to ""wash your hands"" in 21 Indigenous languages.

But when she submitted them to the agency running the global contest, Talenthouse, hers were not included in the final cut.

When she followed up with an email highlighting the importance of including North American Indigenous languages, she received a reply describing a variety of language choices available on the site, including Turkish, Nigerian Pidgin and Hindi — but no Indigenous languages from North America.

Artist Colleen Gray created a series of posters with the phrase “wash your hands” in 21 Indigenous languages. 0:41

Gray, who's part French, part Irish and part Mi'kmaq, found that upsetting, especially given the UN's commitment to Indigenous languages.

""Just the disconnect really frustrated me. I didn't understand what was going on there. So when in doubt, do it yourself,"" said Gray, who instead posted her pieces on her website for free download in April.

Months later, after CBC Ottawa reached out for comment to Talenthouse, the company got in touch with Gray to ask for translations of the messages, with a plan to include them in an upcoming North American collection.

Meantime, Gray had shared them with public health groups and others working in Indigenous communities across Canada, where she's received positive feedback.

There's a lot of elders that don't speak the English language fluently, so to see something in their own language would be comforting, just knowing that somebody cares enough to take the time to give you something in the language of your own upbringing. - Colleen Gray

""At Beaverhouse First Nation, they were very excited to see this and grateful to have the resources. I heard from a nurse in the Mohawk community and she said, 'This is brilliant,'"" Gray said.

Ottawa Public Health recently added Gray's translations to a resource page for First Nations, Inuit and Métis community members.

One of the posters features a woman sitting under a tree and pointing, as if to say, 'Wash your hands.' The other is of a polar bear in a cave, which Gray paired with languages used for Northern communities.

Though government websites have made some public health messages available in some of the more popular Indigenous languages, Gray said she was motivated to make sure none of the smaller communities is forgotten. Her collection covers a wider range of languages including Desuline, Swampy Cree, Innu aimun and Lakota.

Gray says she'll even take requests if there's a language that's not included.

""There's a lot of elders that don't speak the English language fluently, so to see something in their own language would be comforting, just knowing that somebody cares enough to take the time to give you something in the language of your own upbringing. It's very important,"" said Gray, who has connections to many of these communities through her non-profit, called Art for Aid, which delivers new and gently used art supplies to youth in remote Indigenous communities.

This isn't the first time Gray has created art intended to send a public message. Gray's work was posted on a billboard on Highway 174 in Orléans last summer as part of a national campaign to draw attention to MMIWG.

This version of the poster is in the Mi'kmaq language. (Colleen Gray)

Now, she's focused on adjusting the protocols at her non-profit for the COVID-19 era. When the pandemic first hit, she began twice-disinfecting the pencils and paintbrushes that had taken over the basement and garage of her home in Carleton Place, Ont., for fear of unintentionally sending the virus into a vulnerable remote community.

""90 per cent of my skin was pretty ragged by the end of that,"" said Gray, who believes the project is especially important during lockdown.

""Because now is a time when you want to channel things into art, and you also have time or space for that,"" she said.

24891,2020-07-20 4:00,Yearning to travel as COVID-19 drags on? Here's what you need to know now,"As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on and provinces ease their lockdown restrictions, travel is opening up — slowly.

Here's what you need to know now if you're yearning to take a trip — in Canada or beyond.

Domestic travel

Many Canadians have struggled this summer to figure out where they can vacation in Canada. That's because each province and territory has created its own travel rules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and those rules are subject to change.

At this point, Canadians can freely travel to Quebec , Ontario , Saskatchewan , Alberta and B.C . without having to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Visitors to Nova Scotia , Yukon and Manitoba may be required to self-isolate, depending on which part of the country they're travelling from.

Earlier this month, Canada's four easternmost provinces created a travel bubble that allows Atlantic Canadians to travel freely within those provinces — with no self-isolation requirement.

Canadians outside that bubble are barred from visiting Prince Edward Island , New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador — unless they meet specific criteria.

For example, P.E.I. and New Brunswick are letting in people who own cottages in the provinces, provided they self-isolate for 14 days.

WATCH | Atlantic bubble allows travel within those four provinces:

As of today the four Atlantic provinces are allowing travellers to move within the so-called Atlantic bubble. The response was immediate, and overwhelming, as lineups formed. 1:53

Nunavut and the Northwest Territories remain off limits to vacationers from all provinces, with the exception of residents of Churchill, Man., who can enter Nunavut.

To help navigate the varied rules, the Canadian Travel & Tourism Roundtable — a new travel and tourism lobby group — has created an interactive map to assist Canadian travellers.

People can plug in their home province and their potential destination to find out what travel restrictions they may face.

The map also provides links to many provincial websites where Canadians can get the most updated information.

""There is so much confusion,"" said roundtable member Steve Sammut, who's also the CEO of Rocky Mountaineer, a rail-tour company in Western Canada.

""We think it's important for Canadians to understand what their options are at this point.""

International travel

The federal government's advisory against all non-essential international travel during the pandemic remains in effect until further notice — even as other countries start to open their borders.

""Our priority remains the health and safety of Canadians,"" said Global Affairs Canada spokesperson Jason Kung in an email to CBC News.

Because it's an advisory — not an order — Canadians can still travel abroad, but they do so at their own risk. Global Affairs said it's not planning any repatriation flights after July. And until the advisory is lifted, international travellers likely won't be able to purchase medical insurance that covers COVID-19-related illnesses.

""The mentality is, if our own country's advising us not to travel to the United States or Europe or anywhere right now, then we as insurers shouldn't be covering [COVID-19],"" said Toronto-based insurance broker Martin Firestone.

Canadians must also self-isolate for 14 days upon their return home.

Canadians are still limited to where they can travel. The roundtable's website lists countries that have opened their borders. They include Greece, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

Some listed countries have special requirements. For example, the Bahamas and Aruba require travellers to take a COVID-19 test and submit the result before or upon arrival.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed on Friday that Canadians can still fly to the U.S. , as long as they haven't visited Brazil, China, Iran, Ireland, the U.K. or 26 European countries in the Schengen Area 14 days prior.

However, the Canada-U.S. land border remains closed to non-essential traffic until Aug. 21 — and that date could be extended.

Canadians will encounter new rules when flying. They must wear face masks when in transit and at many major Canadian airports.

Temperature checks are already underway for flights to Canada, and by September, most passengers travelling by plane from or within Canada will also face checks.

Before booking your flight, note that while airlines have beefed up cleanliness protocols, they're no longer leaving the middle seat vacant as a safety precaution.

When will Canada reopen its borders?

To help stop the spread of COVID-19, Canada restricts foreigners from entering the country for non-essential travel. On June 8, the federal government loosened the restrictions to allow foreigners to visit immediate family in Canada — including spouses and common-law partners.

The roundtable is lobbying Ottawa to formulate a plan to further ease both cross-border and inter-provincial travel restrictions as a way to help boost the beleaguered travel industry.

The coalition argues that Canada can open its borders with minimal risks if proper health and safety measures are implemented.

Those measures could include widespread COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, as well as excluding certain countries, such as the U.S., where COVID-19 cases continue to spike.

""Nobody's suggesting you throw the borders wide open. It's more about balance,"" said roundtable member Sammut.

The federal government, however, said it's standing firm for now on its travel restrictions.

""While we strongly recognize that Canada's tourism sector is facing significant challenges as a result of the COVID-19 [pandemic], our top priority remains the health and safety of Canadians,"" Industry Canada spokesperson Hans Parmar said in an email.

24892,2020-07-20 4:00,Oilpatch is living in limbo with oil at $40 US per barrel,"After the brutal price crash in March and April, the mood in the oilpatch is noticeably improved as prices stabilize around $40 US per barrel. Still, that price means different things to different companies, with some beginning to turn on the taps to produce more oil, some barely able to break even, and others still struggling mightily.

At Calgary-based Bonterra Energy, the price is high enough to turn a modest profit, but still too low to start drilling for oil again.

For now, executives are holding tight. They don't want to be caught committing big dollars and have oil prices collapse again, especially after they fell into negative territory in April.

""We're sitting on it and watching it almost on a day-by-day basis,"" said George Fink, the company's chief executive, in an interview.

""We're all set up to go back to drilling, but right now we're still just a little bit, being shy.""

The company also temporarily closed many of its higher-cost wells, which Fink wants to bring back online if prices rise above $40.

""You can certainly maintain and grow a little bit at this price, for most of us. But you can't grow aggressively or do acquisitions,"" he said.

Bonterra Energy CEO George Fink says the company has cut back on payroll by lowering hours and reducing some salaries. Only five employees have been laid off. (CBC)

Bonterra is a conventional oil producer that receives a price for its oil close to West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark. Heavy oil producers in Alberta, which include many oilsands players, are receiving a price in the low $30s US per barrel.

Commodity prices are high enough for several oilsands companies to begin restoring thousands of barrels of production.

Cenovus Energy had cut production by 60,000 barrels per day and has brought back 50 per cent of it already. Husky Energy has revived half of the 80,000 barrels per day it had taken offline.

Prices will have to strengthen further before companies ponder major investment in the oilsands or an offshore project near Newfoundland and Labrador.

There is still uncertainty about how the rest of the year will unfold as the $40 WTI price is being supported by significant production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing countries.

In addition, oil storage levels remain high in North America.

And as the number of COVID-19 cases spikes in some U.S. states, there could also be impacts on fuel demand as lockdown measures are re-introduced.

The outlook for several major pipeline projects is also on shaky ground across North America after several recent court decisions and announcements.

MEG Energy has hedged its bets and pre-sold some of the production at its oilsands facility at fixed prices. Still, all of the unknowns aren't lost on chief executive Derek Evans.

""We would like to understand and have a little more clarity on what that supply-demand picture looks like,"" he said during a recent virtual investor conference.

Evans said MEG will likely be one of only a few companies to reduce its debt in 2020.

There is a lack of clarity in terms of what the oil market is going to look like, says MEG Energy chief executive Derek Evans. (CBC)

Some companies have filed for creditor protection, with more expected to follow.

If life at $40 per barrel in the oilpatch doesn't translate into much spending and growth for oil producers, that means there is little work for the oilfield service sector.

Indeed, that part of the oilpatch food chain is in dire straits, especially as an Alberta government program to clean up old oil and gas wells has been plagued with delays, leaving producers to hold back on their own spending as they try to get a piece of the government money.

It's shaping up to be a long summer for many of the companies.

""We're still in the trough of this recession. There's still a ton of unknowns,"" said Marc Rossiter, chief executive of Enerflex, a Calgary-based oil and gas service company.

""The [capital spending] from the producers is slow.""

Three weeks ago, Calfrac Well Services posted a $123-million first quarter loss as revenue plunged 36 per cent compared to the same period in 2019.

The company has since said the recovery will still take some time.

""As you get into September, there seems to be more discussion around what the last part of the year looks like, maybe setting up for some producers to have a good start to 2021. But it's kind of weeks and months away at this point,"" said Scott Treadwell, Calfrac's vice-president of capital markets and strategy.

Last week, the company announced it was restructuring some of its debt under the Canada Business Corporations Act.

Further losses are expected in the next few weeks as companies begin reporting their second quarter results, since prices were very low in April, in particular.

With so much uncertainty in the industry and the spike in COVID-19 cases south of the border, investors will be looking for companies to continue keeping a tight lid on costs.

24893,2020-07-20 4:00,Judge to consider release of more details in N.S. shootings court documents,"In a closed hearing today, a judge and Crown prosecutors representing the RCMP are expected to begin questioning investigators involved in the Nova Scotia shootings as part of CBC's application to unseal search warrants in the case.

Twenty two people died on April 18 and 19 when a 51-year-old denturist went on a killing rampage in rural Nova Scotia. Over about 13 hours and a span of more than 150 kilometres, he gunned down neighbours and strangers, torched homes and shot pets. Police shot and killed the man in Enfield, N.S., after a lengthy search.

In the days that followed, investigators sought approval to search for evidence on the gunman's properties in Portapique, N.S., and Dartmouth, N.S., as well as vehicles and electronic devices. Justices of the Peace agreed to seal the applications, as well as the documents related to what RCMP were searching and what they found.

The Mounties have obtained 23 judicial authorizations in the case and following an application launched by CBC , Judge Laurel Halfpenny MacQuarrie agreed to release parts of seven of them in May.

Those documents revealed people told the investigators the gunman was paranoid, had a history of abuse and had recently stockpiled gasoline . One person described him as a psychopath.

Crown must prove redactions necessary, lawyer says

This week in Port Hawkesbury provincial court, Halfpenny MacQuarrie is scheduled to consider whether the redacted sections of the five search warrants and two production orders should be released to the public. Though some of them are repetitive, there are 1,950 redactions in total.

The blacked out sections include much of the information the shooter's common-law partner gave to police, details in witness statements and the calibre of the firearms used in the attacks.

RCMP requested authorization to search the gunman's property for things such as human remains, documents, firearms, surveillance systems and chemicals. Two items on that list have consistently been redacted.

""The issue for this Court becomes how do I adhere to the principle of an open Court while balancing the need to protect confidential and/or privileged information,"" said Halfpenny MacQuarrie in a June 16 ruling.

Halifax lawyer David Coles said the open court principle means the Crowns have to show each of the redactions is necessary.

He is representing CBC and the six other media outlets that joined the CBC's application: Post Media, the Canadian Press, the Globe and Mail, CTV, Global, Saltwire and the Halifax Examiner.

""Our position is that our courts are presumed to be open and that's what gives confidence from the people that the court system is working properly because they can weigh and see the evidence for themselves,"" said Coles in an interview with CBC.

""If the Crowns want to keep the identities of people confidential or want to argue that revealing information will compromise the investigation, they have to establish that on the evidence. The burden is always with them. Otherwise it's to be released and open to the public.""

Crown argued material should be sealed for 6 months

Provincial Crown prosecutors are representing the interests of the RCMP and the provincial police watchdog agency, which has been tasked with investigating gunman Gabriel Wortman's death.

In submissions filed with the court last month, provincial Crown attorneys Mark Heerema and Shauna MacDonald said that material sealed to protect the investigation — including the models of guns the killer used — should remain sealed for six months .

They also argued that revealing the names of people who spoke to police would threaten their privacy and that disclosing some details, such as whether someone died by gunshot or in a fire, doesn't add to the media's ability to explain the situation but has the potential to cause harm to surviving family members.

The Crowns asked that the details that would ""protect the interests of innocent persons"" remain sealed permanently.

Canadian courts have come up with different processes for how to handle unsealing applications.

For this one, Halfpenny MacQuarrie determined that on Monday and Tuesday, the proceedings will be closed to the public and media as the judge will be evaluating whether the Crown can establish the redactions protect privileged information and that the release of information could harm investigations.

Judge, Crown can question investigators

The judge and the prosecutors will be able to question RCMP Sgt. Angela Hawryluk and Keith Stothart, an investigator with the Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team (SIRT).

Hawryluk, who has been a Mountie for 28 years, authored the RCMP's applications for search warrants and outlined the information she gathered to support them.

As part of the Crown's case, Hawryluk swore an affidavit on June 25. Much of it relates to information the RCMP have uncovered in their investigation into the shootings and those sections were blacked out.

Hawryluk stated the investigation has focused on understanding the gunman's actions ""as well as any individuals who may have rendered assistance to him either before or during the events.""

She said prematurely releasing information could harm the case.

""If other suspects, witnesses or targets yet unknown to the investigation are made aware of the direction of the investigation, they may flee, destroy evidence, attempt to influence other witnesses,"" the document said.

Keith Stothart, the SIRT investigator who is examining the circumstances of Wortman's death, said some details in the search warrant documents could interfere with his work as well.

Federal prosecutors are representing the Canada Border Services Agency, which is involved as police believe three of the firearms the gunman used came into Canada illegally from the U.S. However, no one from the agency filed an affidavit and the agency won't be opposing the release of redacted information in the first seven warrant documents.

24894,2020-07-20 4:00,"Why a fight between Kenney and Alberta's doctors was inevitable, but the path to peace is less clear","Eager young doctors abandoning their dreams of setting up shop in their hometowns. Seasoned physicians, nearing retirement, deflated and dejected. In less than 12 months, the relationship between Alberta physicians and the United Conservative Party government has more than soured. It has imploded.

This should come as no surprise.

Premier Jason Kenney's UCP made its goal clear early — it planned to harness a ballooning health-care budget and take on the issue of physician pay. It laid out those plans in a report that was tailored specifically to make the case for its larger agenda and enshrined them in its first two budgets. It has spent months methodically enacting those plans.

But even more than that, the fight with Alberta's doctors is part of a larger push by the government to refashion Alberta and to do so quickly and aggressively. It's part of a pattern of conflict and condemnation that flows from the office of a premier with a long history of combativeness.

The MacKinnon report

Fuelled by an agenda to rein in spending and with a strong majority, the Kenney government set to work quickly after coming to power in April 2019. The UCP signalled early that health care — which at $20.6 billion eats up 42 per cent of the province's operating budget — would be a key target.

Hefty health-care budgets are common across Canada, but Alberta spends more per capita — $5,254 per person in 2018 — than any other province outside of Newfoundland and Labrador.

By September, a government-commissioned panel created in order to provide a framework and reasoning for the government's coming changes had laid out a plan to balance the budget.

The panel was headed by former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon, who had a public record of opinions and solutions that ensured the government got the recommendations — and justifications — it sought.

One of the key recommendations was to ""limit the increasing cost of physician services,"" which totalled more than $5 billion in 2018-19 and made up 23 per cent of the health-care budget.

The report called for government to move doctors away from the traditional fee-for-service model — a move that has been made in other provinces. But it also introduced the idea of using legislation as a tool to make that happen, which would make Alberta the only province to force the change.

In the months following, the government introduced and passed Bill 21, allowing the health minister to terminate the province's physician compensation agreement with the Alberta Medical Association.

By February, Health Minister Tyler Shandro had invoked that new power, claiming talks with the AMA were at an impasse. The master agreement was terminated, and Shandro announced a plan to impose a number of sweeping changes to doctors' pay.

Some of the more controversial changes — including limits on how much family doctors get paid for longer appointments — were subsequently walked back.

But trust was shattered. The AMA is now suing the provincial government for $250 million.

The Klein years

Has the relationship ever been worse? It got close under Premier Ralph Klein.

""I would say that the docs and the government are in a state of open warfare,"" said John Church, a health policy expert in the department of political science at the University of Alberta.

""It's reminiscent of what went on during the early days of the Klein era during the 1990s.""

Dr. Ernie Schuster has practised family medicine in Edmonton for 35 years and had a front-row seat during Klein's public sector spending cuts, which famously included blowing up the old Calgary General Hospital.

Alberta Premier Ralph Klein speaks at a news conference in Edmonton back in January 2002. (John Ulan/The Canadian Press)

""All I can tell you is I've never seen such a low in the government-physician relationship as I'm seeing right now,"" he said.

For Church, the source of the conflict was the decision by the government to unilaterally tear up the master agreement with the AMA. A move that was made without notifying the association.

Both he and Schuster say that, even during the Klein years, when hundreds of million of dollars were pulled out of the system, the government found a way to bring doctors back into the decision-making process.

""The respect was there, while right now we feel there is very little respect for the profession,"" Schuster said.

The front lines

If the provincial government and physicians are at war, Dr. Christine Molnar is on the front lines as president of the Alberta Medical Association.

""The relationship between government and physicians is at an all-time low right now,"" Molnar said.

""It does look like it's a premeditated plan. That's the basis of our lawsuit.""

The AMA's statement of claim, filed in April, accuses the government of bargaining in bad faith and denying the AMA access to arbitration, all of which the province denies.

When the Alberta government filed its statement of defence on July 9, the health minister reiterated a familiar line in a news release, saying the government's goal was to ""hold the line on cost overruns while maintaining spending at the highest level ever.""

Dr. Christine P. Molnar, president of the Alberta Medical Association, says the relationship between doctors and the provincial government has never been worse. (Submitted)

The AMA released a survey on July 10 suggesting 42 per cent of respondents are considering leaving the province, which prompted a threat from Shandro to include doctors' earnings on a sunshine list of sorts.

The association, which isn't against inclusion on the list as long as it recognizes those payouts do not represent take-home pay after expenses, followed by publishing newspaper ads outlining its latest offer to the government, which was rejected.

The proposal, according to the association, caps physician compensation at the amount the government wants ($4.571 billion per year) for three years, with doctors taking fee cuts if spending exceeds that cap.

The latest salvo came on Wednesday, when it was revealed the health minister had ordered the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta to change its standards of practice in order to prevent doctors from leaving their practices en masse — a backtrack of sorts to previous claims by the minister that doctors were not leaving their practices in any significant number.

Shandro's office did not respond to two requests for an interview for this story.

It's a dizzying back and forth that seems to escalate on a daily basis, but below it all the two sides broadly agree that things need to change.

It's the economy

Few would deny Alberta — with its boom-bust cycle stuck firmly in a bust — needs to reduce spending. In particular, health-care spending.

It's not even a new discussion.

The way doctors are paid has been fodder for a number of reports over at least the past two decades. But there has been little movement away from the traditional fee-for-service model in this province.

A recent paper from the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy called for the province to incentivize more doctors to move voluntarily to alternative payment plans more akin to a salary than set fees for patient visits.

It points to other provinces that have moved away from the fee-for-service model, including Ontario, which brought in higher-paying alternative plans for doctors as enticement that the authors say saves the system money down the road.

Dr. Annelies Noordman left Alberta after 12 years of working here, because she says she was unwilling to sacrifice her values. (Annelies Noordman)

Alberta, the paper says, has the highest proportion of physicians paid by fee for service and some of the highest fee payments in Canada.

According to Jennifer Zwicker, the school's director of health policy, the trouble is Alberta has taken a heavy-handed approach to change — a tactic Zwicker argues likely stems from the long history of little progress.

At the same time, she said, the AMA needs to show a willingness to have constructive discussions about alternative payment strategies.

""In the current fiscal situation in Alberta, we do have to start to think about things differently. I'm not sure that's the mentality that's been coming forward,"" Zwicker said.

There are signs the AMA is open to moving in that direction. The association says it committed to looking at new payment models in its most recent offer to government.

The chaos percolating in Alberta's health-care system was further cemented with the Kenney government's recent introduction of Bill 30.

If passed, the omnibus bill would make it easier for private surgery facilities to set up shop and allow the Health Ministry to contract directly with private companies to run medical clinics.

The legislation also aims to push doctors away from the traditional fee-for-service model to a salary model by making it easier to negotiate individual contracts — known as ARPs — directly with the government rather than through the AMA.

That's a move many doctors reject, so why force the issue?

Kenney's philosophy

Lori Williams, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said ""the million-dollar question"" is why the government is taking such a combative stance with doctors.

She points to poor poll numbers for the government despite the province's success tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and speculates the fight with doctors is a big reason for the lack of a popularity bump.

While other premiers saw approval ratings soar during the pandemic by as much as 22 per cent, Albertans' feelings toward Kenney barely budged.

For example, one survey in late May found 56 per cent of Albertans felt the province would be better off without Kenney in charge — a disapproval rating far higher than those of other premiers and one that had only moved incrementally from 57 per cent in December.

""The last thing you want to be doing is going after front-line medical workers who are, at least in some cases, risking their lives for the health of Albertans,"" Williams said.

But this is a government led by a man who is known to seek out enemies and use them as rhetorical punching bags in service of his agenda. Teachers, nurses, government workers and environmentalists are among those who have felt under attack by the government.

And it's also common for Kenney and his government to meet resistance to that agenda with an all-out counter-assault. In just one example, when the Calgary Board of Education pushed back against cuts to its budget, the government brought in auditors and then threatened to fire the elected board.

The fight with doctors, then, is firmly grounded in a larger way of thinking within the government. And doctors — or the public service writ large — are an obvious mark.

Williams argues Kenney needs to move quickly in order to focus on the positive aspects of his party and its politics in the lead-up to the next election in March 2023.

""He's got to get the unpopular stuff, the tough stuff, the controversial stuff, out of the way, sooner than later,"" she said.

That could be a challenge as both sides dig in for a fight and the issue moves away from cost-cutting and into the realm of trust and working relationships.

Doctors packing up

As the war drags on, some battle-weary doctors are already giving up.

The province — which until recently struggled with a chronic shortage of family physicians — is now at risk of unravelling years of work to recruit and retain those doctors.

Dr. Lindsey Campbell had visions of working as a small-town family doctor while growing up in Alberta, but, just eight years out of medical school, she recently decided to pursue her career in Yukon instead.

She said she can understand the need to take a pay cut during tough times, but ""being labelled as greedy and distrustful and being sometimes outright called liars by the government is just not a working environment [we] want to be in.""

Dr. Lindsey Campbell says she's moving to Yukon to practise medicine given the current climate in Alberta. (Lindsey Campbell)

The sense of betrayal runs deep.

Dr. Annelies Noordman packed up and moved her family back to the Netherlands last week, after working in Alberta for 12 years.

""I'm not willing to sacrifice my own values to stay in Alberta,"" she said. ""I am very pessimistic about my own profession and how I can provide the care in a way ... that I can live with.""

Underpinning all this frustration is a whole lot of uncertainty.

Many rural family doctors run their own clinics and work in a hospital. That means they have expenses, including rent, insurance and staff salaries that don't stop when they're on hospital duty.

All that has proven increasingly difficult as the government levels one policy change after another, choosing to reverse some decisions and push ahead with others.

As a result, doctors are choosing to pull out of rural hospitals in a number of communities, including Lac La Biche, Stettler and Pincher Creek.

In Sundre, all eight family doctors at the Moose and Squirrel clinic stopped providing care at the local hospital on July 1, after giving 90 days' notice. They're now focused solely on working in their clinic.

The government has characterized the moves as job actions akin to strikes.

""We're left in a position where we're trying to read tea leaves from the legislature, "" said Dr. Rob Warren, one of the Sundre doctors.

""I think, over the last three months, it's actually gotten personal. It's about hurting the other side now much more than about trying to find cost savings. And that happens when relationships break down.

""I think we're at the fighting-over-the-silverware point in this relationship.""

An opening or two

But in a broken relationship — no matter what side you're on — rebuilding trust is always a sticking point.

The government, facing the prospect of losing the public relations battle, needs a way to press the reset button. And politically, it needs a way to do that without losing face.

The pandemic could offer that window, according to Zwicker of the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.

""This is an opportunity to restart and reopen these discussions,"" she said, though both sides need to have an open mind.

But after months of battle, the province has signalled time and again it has no intention of retreating. And doctors are unlikely to back down without a change at the top, Warren said.

""I can guarantee you that if the government came forth and said that we are going to shuffle a new minister of health into that portfolio and we are going to commit to binding arbitration, that 95 per cent of doctors in this province would put down their torches and pitchforks, pick up their stethoscopes and go back to work.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-kenney-doctors-government-1.5653948?cmp=rss,news,canada,calgary
24895,2020-07-20 4:00,Long-awaited analysis of downed Flight PS752's black boxes expected to get underway in France,"Experts in France under the supervision of Iranian investigators are expected to start the long-awaited download of Flight PS752's black boxes on Monday, while countries including Canada observe from the sidelines in Paris.

After denying responsibility for days, Iran said it mistakenly shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight with missiles shortly after takeoff in Iran on Jan 8. All 176 passengers onboard died, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents.

Over the weekend, Canada deployed a team of investigators with the Transportation Safety Board to Paris to observe the much-anticipated download and analysis of the plane's two flight data recorders.

""It's a very long, painful journey for all the family members to just have this first piece of information,"" said Hamed Esmaeilion, of Richmond Hill, Ont., north of Toronto. His nine-year-old daughter Reera and wife Parisa Eghbalian died in the crash.

""We need to have our answers.""

The black boxes have been at the centre of an international tug of war for more than six months. Canada, along with countries around the world who lost citizens in the downing, have united to pressure Iran to follow international conventions and transport the recorders to a country capable of reading them without delay.

The download is finally scheduled to start Monday with representatives from multiple countries present, including Canada, Iran, France, Ukraine, the U.S. and Sweden. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne confirmed Sunday the black boxes have officially arrived in Paris.

Canadian experts likely to watch virtually in Paris

Dozens of victims' families in Canada were told by the chair of the TSB that its investigators would likely have to observe the process virtually in another room in Paris via a live video link. The lab's download room isn't big enough to accommodate everyone while properly physically distancing due to COVID-19 measures, according to the association representing families of victims in Canada.

Esmaeilion, the association's spokesperson, said families don't trust Iran and are angry it's taken more than six months to get to this point in the investigation. Families know the black boxes are only a small window into what happened and won't provide answers for what they really want to know: who specifically is responsible for the downing and who decided to keep the airspace open on a night of intense military activity.

""Families are frustrated,"" he said. ""Some of them are so furious they can't wait.""

Recorders could be damaged

The contents of flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders are usually critical to crash investigations. In this case, however, the cause is no mystery: Iran later admitted it shot down the jetliner, saying it was mistaken for an incoming missile. In an interim report last week, Iran's Civil Aviation Organization blamed a misalignment of a radar system and lack of communication between the air defence operator and his commanders for the downing.

Iran has also reported in the past that the recorders could have been damaged in the downing, raising questions about whether experts will be able to read them. France's BEA air accident investigation agency is known as one of the world's leading agencies for reading flight recorders.

The cockpit voice recorder captures the conversations between the pilots and the air traffic controller. The data recorder includes the time the plane took off, its location, altitude, how the plane's engines and system are performing and when the missile struck.

Experts say results will likely be 'anticlimactic'

Larry Vance, a former veteran Transportation Safety Board plane crash investigator, warned that the findings on these black boxes will likely be anticlimactic.

""If people think we're going to get a lot of answers for what happened based on these data recorders, I think they're going to be disappointed,"" Vance told CBC News. ""I think it's going to be quite anticlimactic.""

The data might show that the plane was functioning perfectly, and then it all just stops when the missile strikes and the recorders cut out. Ideally, the recorders might have captured a few seconds of the aftermath and sound of the pilots' reaction in the cockpit, he said.

""The interesting part will be when the first missile struck the airplane, did it disable the data recorders right away, or was there some time span when the electricity continued to flow through them and they continued to operate,"" Vance said.

Results could take weeks to be made public

While the download could happen quickly if the black boxes aren't damaged, it could take weeks for the results to be interpreted and made public. Swedish officials have told citizens it's expecting an update in August, according to a letter obtained by CBC News.

""Once the process of downloading the data from the recorders has been completed, a rather extensive workload follows in order to analyze the thousands of parameters that the information contains,"" said a document from the Swedish Accident Authority dated July 13.

""I expect that part of the process to take two to three weeks.""

The TSB's chair, Kathy Fox, is expected to give an update later on Canada's efforts later Monday morning.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-ps752-black-box-analysis-france-1.5655398?cmp=rss,news,politics,
24899,2020-07-20 4:00,"From drinking helmets to automation, how we might reopen the economy despite COVID-19: Don Pittis","As the Bank of Canada's new governor, Tiff Macklem, reminded us last week, the lockdown to stop the coronavirus epidemic has been costly. And the battle is not over yet.

Those who once thought shuttering the economy to corral COVID-19 was too expensive now merely have to look south , where a strategy of whistling past the graveyard has led to an economically devastating second round of the disease.

Even while some COVID-deniers continue a bizarre refusal to follow simple steps to defeat the pandemic, Canadian businesses may be able to profit from lessons learned abroad.

Using the innovation for which capitalism is famed and the power of good science, it may be possible to have the best of both worlds. Instead of waiting for a vaccine — which some scientists doubt will be as effective as hoped — businesses and policy-makers are seeking strategies to reopen the economy without launching an even more costly renewed outbreak.

From the slightly wacky to the eminently practical, here are some ways Canada might be able to have its cake and eat it too.

Despite increasing scientific evidence that masks are effective, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, seen greeting U.S. President Donald Trump last week, is trying to prevent cities from making mask-wearing compulsory. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)

1. Drinking helmets

From Japanese whisky-producer Suntory comes one of the most interesting COVID-19 business proposals: a specialized drinking helmet that allows the up-close socializing typical in pubs without sharing the virus. The company has not yet revealed prototypes.

Along with Plexiglas barriers, vastly improved ventilation and increased table spacing, the drinking helmet would just be a slightly more eccentric innovation to keep patrons feel safe while showing authorities that bars and restaurants need not be sources of contagion.

2. Automation

As agricultural economist and farmer Philip Shaw told me recently, automation was already sweeping the industry — even in such difficult tasks as tomato picking — before COVID-19 precautions began adding to the costs of temporary foreign workers. Shaw, who worries farmers have not had enough government support during the crisis, says profits depend on imported labour.

But every time costs rise, new technology becomes more feasible. Now, after repeated outbreaks of the disease in meat-packing plants, companies including Tyson Foods are struggling to get machines to do processing jobs that have traditionally been thought to require the finesse of human manual dexterity.

3. Raise wages

Improbable as it may seem, while some traditional business voices are calling for the end of the Canada emergency response benefit — so that employers can persuade workers to come back to lower wage jobs — others insist now is the time to increase employee incomes.

A crisis is an ideal time to raise pay <a href=""https://t.co/xczCEPb6ID"">https://t.co/xczCEPb6ID</a> —@FinancialTimes

Management research shows investing in people pays off in the long run. Usually businesses can't afford to wait. But since businesses aren't expecting immediate returns in this period, this may be a perfect time to hire only essential workers and pay them well.

For those who can afford it, business advocates say paying more will pay off while improving a company's reputation with consumers . And as the Economist reports in this week's edition, as natural capital is expended, human capital becomes the source of a country's economic success.

4. Dial up, dial down

While his suggestions have often been ignored by his boss, on Friday Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the U.S. president's coronavirus task force, had some sound advice on how businesses can ""carefully and prudently"" open the economy, as he told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, without suffering a new outbreak.

One of his pieces of advice is to use a ""dial up, dial down"" strategy — instead of opening businesses everywhere all at once, do it in incremental steps, ready to take a step back if cases begin to increase and avoid the risk of a costly return to lockdown.

5. Some businesses reopen first

It is inevitable that some self-interested businesses including the entertainment and airline industries have been lobbying hard to get back to normal.

""Let's go fly for God's sake,"" American Airlines boss Doug Parker told the Wall Street Journal just as the U.S. was hitting new COVID-19 case records.

But it is clear that different businesses have different risk levels.

In the absence of drinking helmets, for example, bars have been contagion hot spots. Businesses in regions, such as the Atlantic provinces, that have been relatively virus free get to go first while health authorities prepare to pounce on local outbreaks.

6. Listen to science

Last week Air Canada's chief medical officer Jim Chung called on governments to adopt a "" science-based approach "" to reopening the travel industry.

While the appeal was clearly aimed at getting more paying bums in seats, the idea of businesses listening to science seems like one that could have prevented the U.S. second wave and could stop one from happening in Canada. The newness of the disease has meant that medical experts seem to have repeatedly got it wrong .

But as scientists learn more about the disease — and masks, and whether airports and travel, or something else, actually contribute more to the spread of the disease — business leaders may be learning that by accepting scientific advice and adopting innovative techniques, they can maximize profits and bring the economy back without unleashing a disastrous new U.S.-style spike in cases.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/growing-economy-covid-1.5654059?cmp=rss,news,business,

And whether or not to allow special occasion permits (SOPs) for cannabis, potentially allowing for it to be sold at places like festivals.

But for now, the government isn't making any changes.

Jenessa Crognali, a spokesperson for Ontario's attorney general, issued an email statement saying: ""No changes to the cannabis framework are expected at this time nor is there a current timeframe for any additional changes that may be informed by this feedback.""

Crognali confirmed the government will consider the consultation results in the future.

Ford's government has stated its ultimate goal for cannabis is an open market, but at this point it continues to control all legal sales through the Ontario Cannabis Store, which has reported an uptick in online purchases during the pandemic.

However, allowing cannabis cafes — like those seen in places like Amsterdam — is something no Canadian province has done, and it's unclear how it would even work with the province's stated pledge not to change its Smoke-Free Ontario Act.

Ontario health, school officials criticize plan

The Ford government was told by local and regional medical officers of health across the province it should not allow cannabis lounges or make the drug easier to get than it is now.

The Durham Region Health Department, for example, is staunchly opposed. If the province goes ahead with the changes, it wants the power to pass bylaws to ban lounges from ever opening.

""From a public health approach, it becomes concerning when the legalization model changes to a private cannabis retail model with profit being the key driver for expanding business opportunities,"" the department stated in its filing.

The health experts' concern is simple: more access to cannabis will lead to more cannabis-related harm.

That includes issues like impaired driving, public intoxication and other health risks. Multiple organizations, including Ontario Health (which subsumed Cancer Care Ontario), warn that more research on cannabis is needed before the public has a full picture of its risks.

Numerous people in public health also sounded the alarm about the potential mixing of cannabis and alcohol, which can lead to dangerous levels of intoxication.

School directors and boards also objected to the plan, warning loosening the regulations currently in place could lead to more youth using cannabis.

Businesses groups like the idea of an expanded market

However, business groups are lobbying hard on the other side. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce, for example, told the government that ""Ontario's legal cannabis market is not meeting its full potential.""

The Ontario Chamber of Commerce echoed that, adding that in the near future more people will want to consume cannabis in public, social spaces, just like alcohol is consumed.

Niagara College, which has a commercial cannabis production program, said if the government doesn't allow lounges and put some strict rules in place, others will fill the void.

""Going in the other direction — NOT facilitating — one runs the risk of underground lounges and cafes proliferating in non-ideal or unsafe conditions,"" the college said in its submission.

Restaurants Canada, an association representing eateries ranging from coffee shops to caterers, introduced another wrinkle — the potential for unfair competition.

If cannabis is going to be served, said James Rilett, the organization's central region vice-president, it should happen in existing establishments, rather than starting new cannabis cafes.

""If you had a cannabis lounge through the [provincial cannabis] retailer, then obviously they'd start selling food products, they'd start selling coffee and teas, and, you know, all of the sudden we have a competitor that's operating with an advantage.""

A mixed response from the public

Many voiced support for cannabis lounges, suggesting they could be a place to unwind — like bars, but for people who prefer weed to alcohol. Some asked why people can smoke in public, potentially around children, but not in private spaces around consenting adults.

There's also a suggestion it would be a better and safer way for people to be introduced to cannabis.

However, allowing lounges would likely require changing the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, which bans smoking and vaping in any enclosed workplace or public place, as well as on the patio of any bar or restaurant. From the outset, the government said it wouldn't change the act.

Those who wrote in against lounges suggest they'd be a slippery slope to letting people smoke tobacco in bars and restaurants, also citing concerns about the health of those working long shifts in the cafes.

Those opposed to increasing cannabis access at festivals said families and non-smokers who attend those events shouldn't be subjected to the smell and second-hand smoke.

Others sat in the middle ground. Their message to the government: regulate cannabis like you regulate tobacco.

OCS doing better with status quo

Ontario's legal cannabis rollout has faced criticism from day one, with many warning a lack of bricks-and-mortar stores has allowed the black market to flourish. The Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) actually lost money during its first year of operation, but appears to be doing better now — particularly during the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Daffyd Roderick, the director of communications for the OCS, said it's now averaging between 29,000 and 30,000 orders per week.

""Each day of the week is different but we've been averaging 4,200 orders per day,"" Roderick said in an email. ""That is above pre-COVID levels, which was around 2,500 per day.""

24896,2020-07-20 3:48,EU summit on COVID-19 package temporarily breaks after all-night talks,"Weary and bleary European Union leaders temporarily broke up their summit at dawn on the fourth day of acrimonious haggling over an unprecedented 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.8 trillion Cdn) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund to tackle the crisis. They committed to pick up the fight again later Monday.

In a two-day summit scheduled to have ended Saturday, deep ideological differences between 27 leaders forced the talks into Sunday and then through the night until the sun came up again over the EU capital. Grumpy, some leaders lashed out at each other when a common middle ground was still out of reach.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, defending the cause of a group of five wealthy northern nations seeking to limit costs and strict reform guarantees, came under criticism from Italy and Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban asked why the Dutchman had such ""hate"" toward him.

Rutte took it in stride.

""We are not here because we are going to be visitors at each other's birthday party later. We are here because we do business for our own country. We are all pros,"" he said.

The leaders were teetering on the brink of collapse though, Rutte said, before things somewhat turned around before dawn Monday.

""It looks more hopeful than when I thought during the night: `It's over,'"" he said.

(Francois Walschaerts/Pool Photo/The Associated Press)

On Sunday night, after three days of fruitless talks, EU Council president Charles Michel implored leaders to overcome their fundamental divisions and agree on the budget and recovery fund.

""Are the 27 EU leaders capable of building European unity and trust or, because of a deep rift, will we present ourselves as a weak Europe, undermined by distrust,"" he asked the leaders at the end of another day of divisive negotiations. The text of the behind-closed-doors speech was obtained by The Associated Press.

Still haggling early Monday

""I wish that we succeed in getting a deal and that the European media can headline tomorrow that the EU succeeded in a Mission Impossible,"" Michel said.

But early on the fourth day of talks — the summit was meant to last only two — the leaders still had not reached a compromise. As dawn broke Monday, they were still haggling over the size and terms of the recovery fund. Debate centred on whether needy nations should get between 375 billion euros to 390 billion euros in grants, officials said.

Even with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance could not get the bloc's 27 quarrelling nations in line.

At their dinner table Sunday night, the leaders could mull a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations — the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark — that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with 350 million euros of grants and the same amount again in loans. The five EU nations nicknamed ""the frugals"" — had long opposed any grants at all.

""We are ready to take the leap from loans to subsidies. If there are reforms, they need to be strictly defined. And, two, they need to be able to be enforced,"" Rutte said.

The pandemic has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around 135,000 of its citizens and plunging its economy into an estimated contraction of 8.3 per cent this year.

The bloc's executive has proposed a 750 billion-euro coronavirus fund, partly based on common borrowing, to be sent as loans and grants to the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. That comes on top of the seven-year 1 trillion-euro EU budget that leaders have been haggling over for months even before the pandemic hit.

All nations agree they need to band together but the five richer countries in the north, led by the Netherlands, want strict controls on spending, while struggling southern nations like Spain and Italy say those conditions should be kept to a minimum.

Rutte has long been known as a European bridge builder, but this weekend his tough negotiating stance was being blamed for holding up a deal. He and his allies have been pushing for labour market and pension reforms to be linked to EU handouts and a ""brake"" enabling EU nations to monitor and, if necessary, halt projects that are being paid for by the recovery fund.

""He can't ask us to do specific reforms,"" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.

Rutte also wants a link to be made between the handout of EU funds and the rule of law — a connection aimed at Poland and Hungary, countries with right-wing populist governments that many in the EU think are sliding away from democratic rule.

That drew Orban into anger.

""I don't know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary, but he's attacking so harshly and making very clear that because Hungary, in his opinion, does not respect the rule of law, (it) must be punished financially,"" Orban said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/eu-coronavirus-summit-1.5655746?cmp=rss,news,world,
24888,2020-07-20 1:13,UAE's Amal spacecraft rockets toward Mars in Arab world 1st,"A United Arab Emirates spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a seven-month journey to Mars, kicking off the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

The liftoff of the Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, from Japan marked the start of a rush to fly to Earth's neighbour that includes attempts by China and the United States.

The UAE said its Amal was functioning after launch as it heads toward Mars.

Omran Sharaf, the project director of Emirates Mars Mission, told journalists in Dubai about an hour and a half after the liftoff that the probe was sending signals. Sharaf said his team now would examine the data, but everything appeared good for now.

People cheered and clapped, with one woman with offering a celebratory cry common for weddings.

Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since the country's formation.

It blasted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a small southern Japanese island aboard a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' H-IIA rocket, on time at 6:58 a.m. local time (5:58 ET Sunday) into the blue sky. Mitsubishi said the probe has been successfully separated from the rocket and is now on its solo journey.

The launch had been delayed for five days because of stormy weather.

This is us… our dream, aspiration and inspiration. Always looking up to the sky and beyond. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HopeMarsMission?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#HopeMarsMission</a> <a href=""https://t.co/KZ0cbrRFGH"">pic.twitter.com/KZ0cbrRFGH</a> —@HopeMarsMission

At Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center in Dubai, Emirati men in their traditional white kandora robes and women in their black abayas watched transfixed as the rocket lifted off. As its stages separated, a cheer went out from a group of Emirati men seated on the floor. They began clapping, one using his face mask due to the coronavirus pandemic to wipe away a tear.

""It was great to see everything going according to schedule today. It looks like things are all on track. It's a huge step in terms of space exploration to have a nation like the UAE taking that giant leap to send a spacecraft to Mars,"" Astronomer Fred Watson said.

""Being on route to a planet like Mars is an exceptional achievement.""

A newcomer in space development, the UAE has successfully put three Earth observation satellites into orbit. Two were developed by South Korea and launched by Russia, and a third — its own — was launched by Japan.

A successful Hope mission to Mars would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space, coming less than a year after the launch of the first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa Ali Almansoori. He spent over a week at the International Space Station last fall.

The UAE has set a goal to build a human colony on Mars by 2117.

""It sends a very strong message to the Arab youth that if the UAE is able to reach Mars in less than 50 years, they could do much more,"" Omran Sharaf, the project director of Emirates Mars Mission, told The Associated Press on Sunday as his colleagues prepared for the launch.

The Emiratis involved in the program also acknowledged it represented a step forward for the Arab world, the home of mathematicians and scientists for centuries before the wars and chaos that have gripped wide swathes of it in recent times.

""So the region has been going through tough times in the past decades, if not centuries,"" Sharaf said. ""Now we have the case of the UAE, a country that's moving forward with its plans, looking at the future and the future of region also.""

Assembled in Colorado

For its first Mars mission, the UAE chose partners instead of doing it all on its own.

""Developing a spacecraft is not easy even if there is ample funding,"" said Junya Terazono, an astronomer at Aizu University.

Emirati scientists worked with researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder, University of California, Berkeley and Arizona State University. The spacecraft was assembled at Boulder and transported to Japan as the two countries looked to expand their ties with the rich and politically stable Middle Eastern nation.

The Amal spacecraft, along with its launch, cost $200 million, according to Omran Sharaf, the UAE project manager. Operation costs at Mars have yet to be divulged.

Amal, about the size of a small car, carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change while circling the red planet for at least two years. It is set to follow up on NASA's Maven orbiter sent to Mars in 2014 to study how it went from a warm, wet world that may have harboured microbial life during its first billion years, to the cold, barren place of today.

Hope also plans to send back images of weather changes.

More Mars missions planned

Japan, a U.S. ally, has already long collaborated in defence and space technology.

Resource-poor Japan has traditionally kept friendly ties with Middle Eastern countries. In recent years, Japan has increasingly stepped up trade and defence ties with the UAE, and now seeks to expand its space business.

Two other Mars missions are planned in the coming days by the U.S. and China. The U.S. plans to send a rover named Perseverance to search for signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for return to Earth. Liftoff is targeted for July 30. China aims to explore Mars with an orbiter and rover to study the planet's surface, and search for water and ice. This launch is set for around July 23.

Japan has its own Mars mission planned in 2024.

Seattle (2-1-2) clinched a spot in the knockout round of the tournament, rebounding from a disappointing loss to Chicago earlier in the group stage. Seattle will finish either second or third in Group B, depending on Chicago's final group stage match. The top four third-place finishers among all the group advance to the round of 16 and Seattle has at worst clinched one of those spots.

Seattle will not play again until either July 26 or 27.

Raul Ruidiaz also scored for Seattle, which dominated its Cascadia rivals yet again. The Sounders are unbeaten in their past nine matches against Vancouver with six of those victories.

But Morris was the star for Seattle. The winger drew the penalty that led to Lodeiro's opening goal in the 16th minute. Morris's shot caught the hand of Vancouver defender Jasser Khmiri, and Lodeiro sent Whitecaps goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau the wrong direction on the penalty.

Whitecaps losing matches and available players

Morris then got his own goal later in the first half collecting a chipped pass from Lodeiro, holding off his defender and beating Crepeau. Morris had two goals in Seattle's season opener back in March.

Ruidiaz added cushion early in the second half, scoring off a corner kick and a flicked header from Handwalla Bwana.

Seattle opened the tournament with a 0-0 draw against group winner San Jose and a 2-1 loss to Chicago. The Sounders will have to wait for the result of Thursday's group finale between Vancouver and Chicago to determine their placing and opponent in the knockout round.

Vancouver (1-3-0) was already short-handed entering the tournament with a number of key players opting out, and now may be without its goalkeeper.

Crepeau had to be subbed out early in the second half after his hand was inadvertently stepped on.

30 years later a Mohawk filmmaker reflects on the Oka crisis

It’s been 30 years since an explosion of violence and the death of a Quebec provincial police officer on an early July morning marked the beginning of the Oka Crisis. That summer, thousands of Canadian soldiers surrounded two Mohawk communities, just outside Montreal, who were trying to protect a forest and burial ground from the expansion of a golf course. Today on Front Burner, we speak to Mohawk filmmaker Tracey Deer who grew up in Kahnawake, Quebec. She shares what it was like living through a standoff that came to be a defining conflict in Canadian history.

Hughes, of Dundas, Ont., finished in a tie for sixth on Sunday at the Memorial to earn a spot in the major tournament.

He'll join fellow Canadians Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., and Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., at Winged Foot when the U.S. Open tees off in the fall.

Hughes, who also qualified for the U.S. Open in 2013 and '18, had three birdies — including one on No. 12 with 67-foot putt — and three bogeys for a 72 in the final round of the Memorial to finish 3 under.

Hughes and runner-up Ryan Palmer earned U.S. Open spots as the leading two players from the top 10 who were not already eligible.

Henrik Norlander could have taken the final spot with a par on the 18th, but made bogey to tie Hughes at 3 under. The spot went to Hughes because he had the better world ranking.

Jon Rahm struggled to a 3-over 75 but held on to win the tournament by three strokes over Palmer at 9 under.

Rahm, who held an eight shot lead at the turn before a difficult back nine, joins Seve Ballesteros as the only Spaniards to reach No. 1 in the world golf rankings following the victory — leapfrogging Rory McIlroy, who held the top ranking since Feb. 9.

Meanwhile, Conners (72) came in a tie for 22nd at 3 over and Hadwin (81) fell down to 54th at 9 over.

Jumps to No. 75 in World Golf Rankings

Hughes will go from No. 97 to a career-best No. 75 in the world golf rankings following the Memorial.

He shot a 60 in the first round of the Travelers Championship less than a month ago and finished the tournament third, while also grabbing second place at the Honda Classic in March before the COVID-19 pandemic halted golf.

When racial unrest erupted in the United States several weeks ago, NBA coaches and players quickly came together to brainstorm ideas to help in the fight against racial and social injustice.

One of the Raptors' initiatives was a social media campaign to urge Americans living north of the border to vote in November's U.S. presidential election.

""We thought we could use our platform with the Raptors and make awareness to it, and actually show people how simple it is (to register and vote), tell them what the website is, and kind of keep that message now,"" Nurse said.

""Talk about me personally, I would have said when I was younger maybe that I didn't know how to do (vote), didn't like either candidate, didn't think my vote counted enough, whatever, all those excuses — it's time I think for everybody to exercise their right and we're happy to help promote it.""

Nurse, who's lived in four different countries — United States, Canada, England and Belgium — said he's a typical example of people living abroad.

'It's a simple process'

""I haven't exercised my right to vote enough over the years. There's no excuses anymore, so get out there and show people how to do it and pave the way,"" Nurse said.

The public service announcement, released Saturday night, features Raptors coaches and players directing Americans to the website FVAP.gov to register for an absentee ballot.

""It's a simple process. . . and it gives you the opportunity to make your voice heard even when you're living in Canada,"" assistant coach Jim Sann tells viewers.

A major theme of the NBA restart has been about amplifying social and racial justice messages.

Nurse said police and voter reform were two of the main themes that have come out of player and coach discussions.

24877,2020-07-19 20:47,"Jon Rahm cruises to win at Memorial, becomes new world No. 1","Jon Rahm won the Memorial to join Seve Ballesteros as the only Spaniards to reach No. 1 in the world, a victory he finally wrapped up with a magical shot that would have made his idol proud.

Rahm built an eight-shot lead at the turn, only to see it reduced to three shots with three holes to play Sunday on a Muirfield Village course playing its toughest in 42 years.

In trouble behind the green on the par-3 16th, with Ryan Palmer facing a 12-foot birdie putt from the fringe, Rahm hit a flop shot from deep grass that came out perfectly. It landed on the fringe, ran toward the hole and dropped for birdie as the fiery Spaniard let out a ferocious fist pump.

Palmer took bogey on the 17th, and the coronation was on.

The only issue was the score. Replay of Rahm's chip appeared to show the ball moved ever so slightly when he placed his lob wedge behind it. PGA Tour officials reviewed it and gave him a two-shot penalty. It didn't affect the outcome.

Rahm was surprised when it was mentioned to him after he finished and said he didn't realize anything was wrong.

WATCH | Jon Rahm wins Memorial Tournament:

Jon Rahm wins the Memorial Tournament to earn a victory in 4 straight seasons. 1:52

""It doesn't take anything from the shot,"" he said. ""It's not going to take anything away from today.""

Rahm closed with a 3-over 75 for a three-shot victory over Palmer, the highest final round by a Memorial winner since Roger Maltbie shot 76 in the inaugural year in 1976.

The victory was the 10th of Rahm's career — fourth on the PGA Tour — and moves him past Rory McIlroy in the world ranking by winning against the strongest field of the year. He is the 24th player to be No. 1. Ballesteros spent a total of 61 weeks at the top from 1986 to 1989.

It was the strongest test, too, with the rough not being cut and the greens allowed to bake out because they are being replaced. The fifth green already was stripped as the leaders were on the back nine.

Only five players broke par, the fewest for a final round since the Memorial began in 1976. The average score of 75.932 was the highest for the final round since it was 75.972 in 1978.

Rahm looked to be playing a different course. He played bogey-free on the front nine with birdies on the two par 5s. That put him eight shots clear on his way to No. 1.

And then he made bogey on the 10th. Not a problem.

He yanked his tee shot into a creek on the par-5 11th, and that was a bigger problem based on how hard he slammed the club into the ground in a pique of anger. He made double bogey. Palmer made birdie on the 12th, and then Rahm made another bogey from the bunker on the 14th.

Just like that, the lead was three shots.

Only a week ago at Muirfield Village for the Workday Charity Open, Justin Thomas had a three-shot lead with three holes to play and wound up losing in a playoff to Collin Morikawa.

Woods struggles in 1st event since Feb. 16

Rahm only wanted his tee shot on the 16th to stay dry, though the rough was not a great option with how fast the greens were running. The chip was similar — but from a different angle — to Tiger Woods chipping in from behind the 16th green when he won the Memorial for the fifth time in 2012.

Woods, in his first competition since Feb. 16 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, shot 76 and tied for 40th.

""Tough, tough conditions to start out my first week back, Thursday and Sunday,"" Woods said. ""But it was good to get the feel and the flow of competing again.""

Canadian Mackenzie Hughes earns berth at U.S. Open

Matthew Fitzpatrick had a 68 for the low score of the final day to finish third.

The consolation prize went to Palmer (74) and Mackenzie Hughes (72) of Dundas, Ont., who earned spots in the U.S. Open at Winged Foot in September as the leading two players from the top 10 who were not already eligible.

Henrik Norlander could have taken the final spot with a par on the 18th, but he missed the fairway well to the right, couldn't reach the green and made bogey. Norlander and Hughes tied at 3-under 285, but the spot went to Hughes because he had the better world ranking.

24876,2020-07-19 20:28,Kanye West draws crowd to first event since declaring run for U.S. president,"Rapper Kanye West, in his first event since declaring himself a U.S. presidential candidate, delivered a lengthy monologue Sunday touching on topics from abortion and religion to international trade and licensing deals. Whether he's actually seeking the nation's highest office remains a question.

West said that while he believes abortion should be legal, financial incentives to help struggling mothers could be a way to discourage the practice.

""Everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars,"" he said as an example.

Wearing a protective vest and with ""2020"" shaved into his head, the entertainer spoke before a crowd in North Charleston, S.C. According to a livestream of the event, it appeared that several hundred people had gathered in a venue, where gospel music played before West's appearance.

The event was reportedly for registered guests only, although a campaign website had no registration or RSVP information.

THE WEST WING <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/2020VISION?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#2020VISION</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QvhgIzJCcv"">pic.twitter.com/QvhgIzJCcv</a> —@kanyewest

Speaking without a microphone, West became tearful at one point while talking about his mother, who died following plastic surgery complications in 2007.

West has missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it's unclear if he is willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others. Last week, he qualified to appear on Oklahoma's presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the filing deadline.

West needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon Monday to appear on the South Carolina ballot, according to state law. The entertainer tweeted out a list of locations around the Charleston area where petitions could be signed. Email to an address purportedly associated with the campaign was not returned Sunday afternoon.

West has in the past been a vocal supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, and even had lunch with the president at the White House in October 2018, where he and Trump gave a long and rambling news conference.

But in a four-hour interview with Forbes Magazine released on July 8 and just days after saying he'd be making a presidential bid, West says he is ""taking the red hat off"" and no longer supports Trump.

24875,2020-07-19 18:21,Jack Nicklaus says he tested positive for coronavirus earlier this year,"Jack Nicklaus revealed Sunday during the CBS telecast of the Memorial that he and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus at the onset of the pandemic.

Nicklaus and his wife, Barbara, turned 80 a month apart at the start of the year.

He said his wife had no COVID-19 symptoms, while Nicklaus had a sore throat and a cough. Nicklaus said they were home in North Palm Beach, Florida, from March 13 ""until we were done with it"" on about April 20.

""It didn't last very long, and we were very, very fortunate, very lucky,"" Nicklaus said. ""Barbara and I are both of the age, both of us 80 years old, that is an at-risk age. Our hearts go out to the people who did lose their lives and their families. We were just a couple of the lucky ones.""

The Memorial has no spectators, and Nicklaus sightings have been rare this week because of protocols in the PGA Tour's return to golf amid the pandemic.

Nicklaus shared the news when the Memorial was coming out of a weather delay in the final round. The few times he has been seen, he was wearing a mask and keeping his distance.

Tiger Woods, a five-time winner of the Memorial, said he had known for some time Nicklaus had tested positive.

""The fact that they got through it and they're safe and here and healthy, it's all good news for all of us who are a part of golf and who looked up to Jack and (have) been around Barbara all these years,"" Woods said.

Nicklaus wants to shake hand of Memorial winner

Nicklaus had a remote press conference on Tuesday and said he would shake the hand of whoever wins the Memorial, a tradition at the tournament he created.

""If they don't want to shake my hand, that's fine, I'll give them a fist bump or an elbow bump, but I'm not going to give them COVID-19, so that's ... I wouldn't put anybody in that position,"" he said Tuesday.

He said again on CBS that he'll shake hands if the winner wants to, but he would be fine if the winner doesn't.

""We've got the antibodies, and theoretically we can't get it and can't give it,"" he said. ""That's a nice position to be in.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a June 30 update, said it does not know if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. It also said even with a positive test for antibodies, ""you still should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/jack-nicklaus-tested-positive-for-coronavirus-1.5655603?cmp=rss,sports,golf,
24874,2020-07-19 17:27,Blue Jays could share MLB ballpark with another team for 60-game season,"Toronto Blue Jays reliever Anthony Bass doesn't want to settle on using a minor-league field for a home ballpark this season.

And the team's front office seems to agree.

Bass, who joined the Blue Jays off waivers from the Seattle Mariners in October, says general manager Ross Atkins has told the team they'd prefer to set up home base in a big-league stadium rather than using their triple-A field in Buffalo, N.Y.

""I got a chance to talk with Ross yesterday ... and I just said: 'Look, we want to play in a major-league ballpark, we feel like that's the best opportunity for us.' And he agreed,"" Bass said on a video call with reporters Sunday.

""He said: 'I listen to you guys loud and clear. And that's what we're going to do for you because that's what the team wants.""'

WATCH | Government rejects Jays' plan to play at Rogers Centre:

CBC News' David Cochrane discusses the reasons why the federal government rejected the Toronto Blue Jays' request to play regular season baseball games in Toronto. 7:04

The Canadian government denied the Blue Jays' request for permission to play home games at Toronto's Rogers Centre — where they've been training for the last two weeks — saying it's not safe for players to constantly travel over the Canada-U.S. border during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Blue Jays and teams coming into Toronto for road games would have needed special permission from the government to waive the mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for anyone crossing the border for non-essential reasons.

Team was 'surprised' by goverment's decision

The federal government's decision came Saturday, less than a week before the start of the 60-game MLB season. The Blue Jays open against the Rays in Tampa Bay on July 24 and their home opener is set for five days later against Washington.

Bass said the team was ""definitely surprised"" when told the would need to find a new home.

""We were disappointed initially, but at the same time we respect the Canadian government's decision,"" Bass said. ""We understand what's going on globally. And with that being said, our focus in our direction was we need to put ourselves in the best situation to win. ... And it felt like that was pretty much echoed throughout the clubhouse that we want to be in a major-league ballpark, wherever that is.""

Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro said Saturday that the team has spent more time examining Buffalo in recent days but that the stadium has infrastructure challenges.

Minor-league fields aren't always equipped with proper behind-the-scenes resources — like not enough batting cages for hitters, for example — and they tend to have smaller clubhouses.

But finding a big-league park to play out of would bring its own challenges with the Blue Jays having to share a facility with another team.

While Bass acknowledged there could be downsides to not having a true home stadium, he said the benefits of a major-league park outweigh those, and that the team is ""willing to make some sacrifices.""

'It doesn't make a difference because it's a baseball field'

Outfielder Teoscar Hernandez, meanwhile, says that while he'd prefer a major-league field, it doesn't matter to him where the Blue Jays end up playing their home games.

""It doesn't make a difference because it's a baseball field,"" he said. ""You're not gonna get the beautiful things they have at major league fields (at) some minor-league field, but for me, it's gonna be the same.""

Manager Charlie Montoyo says the Blue Jays will be ready for action this week regardless of where they'll be playing.

Toronto has a pair of pre-season games in Boston before travelling to Tampa, and Montoyo said being able to train in Toronto has ensured his team is — relatively — healthy heading into the season.

Several Blue Jays players and staff members reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 last month while working out at their spring-training facility in Dunedin, Fla.

""Of course, it's a lot better to play (home games) in Toronto ... to be (in) our home ballpark, but that's not gonna happen,"" Montoyo said. ""So we're not gonna use it as a built-in excuse. Wherever we go, we're gonna have to play to win, wherever that is.""

Bass, who has a young daughter in a high-risk category for a bad COVID-19 outcome, says the location of Toronto's home field matters both in terms of how ready it is for major-league games and how safe it is.

While earlier reports had suggested the Blue Jays were looking into sharing Tropicana Field with the Rays in St. Petersburg, Fla., Bass said the team would prefer to not be in a COVID ""hotspot"" like Florida, which reported 10,328 COVID-19 cases Saturday.

""We want to be where it's safe — a place in the United States where cases are going down, or they're very low,"" said Bass, who added his family won't be with him this season regardless of where they play.

""So that's definitely a concern of ours.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/blue-jays-share-stadium-season-60-games-mlb-1.5655579?cmp=rss,sports,baseball,mlb
24873,2020-07-19 16:58,WNBA players adjusting to life in their Florida bubble,"Sue Bird has seen a lot in her storied playing career in the WNBA, overseas and the Olympics. While nothing the 39-year-old Seattle Storm guard experienced has prepared her for life in the WNBA bubble, she is making the best of the situation.

The WNBA put all 12 of its teams at a single site — the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida — in hopes of playing the full 22-game season amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""The bubble is part summer camp, mixed in with the Olympic village, playing overseas and an AAU tournament with a little bit of college life thrown in,"" Bird said in a phone interview.

Two weeks into the experiment, players and coaches have been adjusting to their temporary homes.

Players compare bubble to playing overseas

""It's like overseas, but a little bit easier as far as access to things as you can order in and it's less isolating since you have so many of your friends around,"" Bird's teammate Breanna Stewart said. ""In the end, getting here and seeing how everything has come to fruition, I know it's going to work, as long as everyone's smart and continues to be safe. We're trusting everyone that's here is going to be safe.""

Stewart is living in a villa with some of her Storm teammates while Bird is staying at the hotel on site. Players were given the option of where they wanted to live.

The street where the villas are located — a few minutes from the hotel — has the feel of a sorority row.

Each team was given two golf carts and they are usually parked in front of the villas where the players or operations staff are staying. Atlanta glossed up its carts with the team's new logo on the front.

""You say hello to people and could bump into someone a few times a day from another squad,"" New York guard Sabrina Ionescu said. ""It feels like the Nike Nationals AAU Tournament. You could be eating next to a team or hanging out at the pool with players that you're going to be playing against later that day.""

While a few players voiced their concerns the first few days about the quality of food and accommodations, the league quickly addressed those issues.

'Far and beyond what I thought would happen'

With their quarantines concluded, players and staff now have a robust array of food options offered daily at the hotel. Or players can get groceries delivered and cook for themselves in the villas. The hotel is also where the league does its daily virus testing.

""Food has been great. Service has been great. People have had issues with their housing. but there is no protocol for this, and the league took care of it,"" Phoenix Mercury veteran Diana Taurasi said. ""This is the first time anyone has done this. The WNBA has gone far and beyond what I thought would happen.""

Even with the WNBA in the bubble, the virus is still on everyone's mind. Players wear masks unless they are eating. When they line up for food and testing, marks on the ground remind them to stand at least 6 feet apart.

People can hang out in the hotel lounge, which has tabled spread apart to maintain social distancing. The pool has become a popular spot during the day and at night.

Even with the leisure activities, many players spend their free time relaxing in their rooms.

""There is a lot of sitting in your room, FaceTime with your family,"" Taurasi said. ""It's not ideal, but everyone's trying their best to make sure they we are comfortable mentally and physically.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/wnba-players-adjusting-to-life-in-bubble-in-florida-1.5655548?cmp=rss,sports,basketball,
24872,2020-07-19 16:41,Roger Stone calls Black radio host racial slur in interview,"Roger Stone, a political operative whose 40-month prison sentence was commuted this month by President Donald Trump, his longtime friend, used a racial slur on air while verbally sparring with a Los Angeles-based Black radio host.

The exchange occurred on Saturday's Mo'Kelly Show, whose host — Morris O'Kelly — grilled Stone on his conviction for lying to Congress, tampering with witnesses and obstructing the House investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.

The first part of Stone's statement was not entirely audible, but the radio program transcribed the complete sentence as, ""I can't believe I'm arguing with this Negro.""

O'Kelly on his program's website said ""Stone could have reached for any pejorative, but unfortunately went there,"" adding that ""Stone offered an unfiltered, unvarnished one-sentence expression of how he saw the journalist interviewing him.""

I'm nobody's NEGRO (The Roger Stone Podcast audio)<a href=""https://t.co/9bMJOVGhgZ"">https://t.co/9bMJOVGhgZ</a> —@MrMokelly

He characterized the word as the ""low-calorie version of the N-Word.""

Stone's attorney on Sunday said he was unaware of the broadcast and had no immediate comment.

Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison, but Trump commuted that sentence on July 10 — just days before Stone was to report for detention.

The exchange

As O'Kelly asserted that Stone's commutation was because of his friendship with Trump, Stone's voice goes faint but can be heard uttering that he was ""arguing with this Negro.""

O'Kelly then asks Stone to repeat the comment, but Stone goes momentarily silent.

O'Kelly persisted on having Stone respond.

""I'm sorry you're arguing with whom? I thought we were just having a spirited conversation. What happened?"" O'Kelly said. ""You said something about 'Negro.""'

Stone said he had not. ""You're out of your mind,"" he said.

The interview then continued.

In a statement, Stone defended himself by saying that anyone familiar with him ""knows I despise racism!""

""Mr. O'Kelly needs a good peroxide cleaning of the wax in his ears,"" Stone said, maintaining that at ""no time"" did he use the word, using lowercase for the term.

""That said, Mr. O'Kelly needs to spend a little more time studying black history and institutions,"" he said, arguing the word ""is far from a slur.""

He cited the United Negro College Fund and the historical use of the word.

At one time the term was common in the American vernacular to describe African Americans. By the late 1960s, however, the word was scorned by activists in favour of such descriptors as Black.

These days, the antiquated word is widely viewed as derogatory in most uses.

In his statement, Stone noted that some of the program's audio was garbled and alleged that there was cross-talk from another radio show and that his sound was cut off.

During the program, Stone said the president acted out of compassion and that the jury that weighed his case was tainted.

24870,2020-07-19 15:10,"Lockdown fatigue, 'invincibility' causing more COVID-19 infections in young people","More young people are being infected with COVID-19, creating the potential for a severe outbreak, scientists warn.

They say the change in demographics could be attributed to lockdown fatigue, increased testing or feelings of invincibility.

Brett Snider, a water resources PhD student at the University of Guelph, first noticed a higher number of infections in the under 20 and 20-29 age groups in the Toronto and Peel regions in May.

Snider's supervisor, Ed McBean, said he was puzzled by rising infections in the under 20 age group because daycares and schools were closed.

""And we thought 'whoa'. The little ones don't tend to get violently ill, but they will bring it home. And if you have multiple generations or even visitors, you get that uptick as a result,"" said McBean, an engineering professor at the University of Guelph.

While the numbers have stabilized in Peel and Toronto, McBean said there's been an increase in infections in younger people in other parts of the country.

""That's critical because once you start to get an uptick, it can explode very quickly,"" he said.

Infections in under-20 age group

McBean said he's especially worried about the increase in infections in the under-20 age group.

Children who may be sick don't usually show symptoms and when they share a space or toys, they might spread the infection to others and then carry it home, he said.

""If we start to see an increase in the younger age category there's no doubt that it'll eventually spread from the parent to the grandparent, and it can have severe impacts on older populations.""

McBean said his message for public health officials is to keep daycares and schools closed.

Data from British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island show an increase in COVID-19 infections in the 20-29 age groups. The figures also show more women are testing positive for COVID-19.

Numbers from the Public Health Agency of Canada show that during the second week of July, the largest proportion of new cases reported — 22 per cent of female cases and 28 per cent of male cases — was among the 20-29 age group.

Watch | Dr. Bonnie Henry asks young people to help not let COVID-19 ""steal our summer"":

B.C.'s provincial health officer is asking people in their 20s and 30s to socialize in safe ways and keep track of their contacts at parties. 2:07

Since the start of the pandemic, 14 per cent of female cases and 15 per cent of male cases have been up in that age group.

The younger age groups are now making up a higher percentage of positive tests, while older age groups are falling overall, the data show.

A clinical professor at the University of B.C.'s school of population and public health said the increase could be because it's summer and fewer employment opportunities during the pandemic mean more time for young people to spend with friends.

Stephen Hoption Cann said when they get together in larger groups, young people can potentially spread the virus because they may not show symptoms or have a mild infection.

""They have to be cautious in social gatherings, pubs and bars,"" he said.

""You never really know when you're close to the person who might be infected so you have to be more cautious.""

Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, said health officials have noticed the same trend, noting healthy people either don't show symptoms, have very mild symptoms or they don't know they have COVID-19.

""I think that contributes to potentially, some complacency,"" she said at a recent news briefing.

While young people may not see the infection as a ""big deal,"" they may pass it on to a person they're close with who has an underlying medical condition, Yaffe said.

B.C. public health officials said early on many long-term care and assisted living facilities were hard hit and now most of the province's new cases are in the broader community.

""We are concerned about the increase in new cases in recent days as COVID-19 continues to silently circulate in our communities,"" B.C.'s health minister and provincial health officer said recently in a statement.

Higher infection rates among women

Another factor for consideration is a larger number of infections among women.

Julia Smith, a research associate at Simon Fraser University's faculty of health sciences, said Canada had a higher proportion of women infected than other countries near the start of the pandemic.

Age and employment may be factors, she said. Most residents of long-term care homes tend to be women, she noted. Such homes were the first to be hit with COVID-19 in Canada, killing thousands of seniors.

Women also tend to make up a larger share of health-care workers who would have more interactions with patients, putting them at greater risk of infection, Smith said.

McBean said the messaging to maintain safe social distancing and frequent handwashing, wear a mask and get together in small groups outdoors remains the best way to avoid infection.

Keeping the Canada-U.S. border closed for as long as possible would also help prevent external infections from coming into the community, he said.

McBean said provinces need to continue to follow strict protocols to keep the virus contained, and keep the R value below one. The R value or reproduction rate represents the average number of new people who will catch the disease from one infected person. If R value is less than one, then the epidemic is being brought under control. If R is greater than one, then the epidemic is growing.

""We're on a very fine line as it is right now in Ontario. So, we just have to be very careful in that number doesn't start to creep up again and be above one,"" McBean said.

McBean said provinces need to continue to follow strict protocols to keep the virus contained.

""Basically, we're doing pretty well,"" he said. ""I mean this is a terribly infective virus and so easily transmitted.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lockdown-fatigue-invincibility-causing-more-covid-19-infections-in-young-people-1.5655401?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia

Three people died and 24 others were injured — many of them critically — after a glacier sightseeing bus rolled over near the Columbia Icefield in the Alberta park on Saturday afternoon.

Lauren Johnston of Calgary was with her husband waiting in line for the 2:30 p.m. tour bus to arrive when staff suddenly informed the waiting guests that the tours were cancelled for the rest of the day.

In an interview with CBC News Network Sunday, Johnston said they noticed a large plume of dust rising in the distance. When they first saw emergency vehicles arriving on the scene, she assumed someone had been injured.

Eventually, Johnston said, she decided to take out her long-lens camera to see what was happening, and that's when she saw the overturned bus in the distance.

""I was shocked. I was using my camera to actually zoom in on it, so I remember just 'oh my goodness' when I realized it was upside down,"" she said. ""It was crazy.""

Johnston said she and her husband had been offered tickets for the earlier time slot when the bus crashed and that it's ""frightening"" to think about what could have happened.

""We were fortunate,"" she said. ""I wish the best for the folks who are trying to recover right now.""

She said as they tried to leave the area, an air ambulance and a number of ground ambulances were on the scene.

In a news release issued Sunday, the RCMP in Alberta said no new deaths had been reported to police. Local police, collision reconstructionists, Occupational Health and Safety, and Alberta Commercial Vehicle enforcement are continuing to investigate. Police said efforts are being made to remove the bus from the site so it can be examined further.

Photos and video show the red-and-white bus flipped onto its roof on a rocky slope near the Athabasca Glacier, which is one of the toes of the Columbia Icefield about 100 kilometres south of Jasper.

Pursuit, the company that owns the bus, reopened its icefield tours about a month ago with 50 per cent capacity after being closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Dave McKenna, president of Pursuit's Banff Jasper Collection, issued an emailed statement about the crash on Sunday.

24856,2020-07-19 13:16,Canadian military issues new orders in effort to crack down on 'hateful conduct',"The Canadian Armed Forces has issued new orders to military personnel as senior commanders seek to address allegations of having been soft on hate in the ranks.

The orders, which aim to take a harder line on ""hateful conduct,"" follow a rash of high-profile incidents in which the military was caught flatfooted as service members were publicly linked to hateful actions or groups.

""The year before, it was more like a reaction kind of approach,"" said Maj.-Gen. Marc Gagne, who oversees strategy, plans and policy within the chief of military personnel's office. ""We were reacting to cases.""

The new direction also comes as the military is actively working to recruit more women, visible minorities and Indigenous people to ensure it reflects Canadian society and is better able to operate in diverse theatres.

The new order aims to leave no doubt about what constitutes ""hateful conduct"" by banning anything — words, images or symbols — that encourages, justifies or promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups.

That includes discrimination based on nationality or ethnic background, race, colour, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status or disability.

""We were talking about different forms of misconduct: sexual misconduct, harassment, discrimination,"" Gagne said. ""But 'hateful conduct' was never clearly articulated.... We broke new ground by developing this definition.""

Reporting required

Troops are required to report any and all incidents while military commanders are expected to take action when incidents are brought to their attention. All have been warned that they will be held to account if they do not.

A database has also been created to track such incidents, based on the system created to monitor sexual misconduct in the ranks. New training for troops and screening for recruits is being developed.

""The idea is basically as soon as you join, it's crystal clear, and we're going to keep reinforcing through education and training as you move through the ranks and as you assume more responsibility,"" Gagne said.

Bernie Farber, chair of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, described the new orders and definition as a positive and long overdue step. But he said only time will tell whether the military follows through in addressing hate in the ranks.

""Right now, these are just words,"" he said. ""They are good words.... But too often in the past, when they investigated, it has really only resulted — to the best of our knowledge — in a slap on the wrist. What we need to see from the Canadian Armed Forces is they take meaningful actions.""

The new approach follows a number of incidents in recent years in which the military has been accused of not doing enough to root out hate from the ranks.

Those incidents have ranged from sailors associated with the Proud Boys group disrupting a Mi'kmaq ceremony in Halifax in 2017 to the case of a Manitoba army reservist who was accused of being a recruiter for a neo-Nazi group.

Concerns over systemic racism

Patrik Mathews is currently in custody in the U.S. with two other men after disappearing from his home in Beausejour, Man. The FBI has accused them of plotting to start a race war on behalf of The Base, a white-supremacist group.

Senior commanders also faced months of questions and criticism after a military intelligence report in 2018 identified 30 service members as belonging to hate groups or having otherwise made discriminatory or racist statements.

The Armed Forces eventually reported in November that 16 of those members had been warned, disciplined or ordered to take counselling but allowed to stay in uniform. A number of other cases were described as ""ongoing.""

It also comes amid concerns about systemic racism within the military, RCMP and other government institutions.

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jonathan Vance and Defence Department deputy minister Jody Thomas last month apologized for their slow response to questions about systemic racism.

Service members have been told that more detailed policies and orders on systemic racism are coming soon.

Gagne said the new orders are just the first step in a much longer effort to change attitudes within the Armed Forces and ensure the military is leading by example when it comes to hate.

""To change culture, to change group dynamics, to change or modify perceptions and beliefs will take time,"" he said ""But we had to take action. Somebody may think this is a one-off. But those little one-offs could erode the institution.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/military-hate-orders-1.5655353?cmp=rss,news,canada,
24879,2020-07-19 13:00,4 dying Canadians wait to hear if they'll be allowed to try magic mushrooms for their anguish,"It's been about three months since four dying Canadians filed applications with the federal government asking for the right to try magic mushrooms to treat the psychological distress that comes with facing the end of their lives.

The psychedelic fungi have shown promise in relieving some of the anxiety and depression faced by those suffering with terminal cancer, but the active ingredient psilocybin is still undergoing clinical trials.

Victoria psychotherapist Bruce Tobin, founder of the advocacy group TheraPsil, says completing those trials is absolutely necessary before magic mushrooms can be made widely available.

But he believes terminally ill patients deserve compassionate access to something that might help with their anguish when other treatments have failed.

""Canadian society now acknowledges that citizens have the right to die,"" Tobin told CBC News, referring to the legalization of medical assistance in dying.

""How is it that we're going to allow them to die when they affirm that their lives are intolerable, but we won't acknowledge their right to try something that could allow them to continue their life in a meaningful way?""

Research is currently underway to determine if psilocybin is safe and effective to treat things like depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and substance use disorder. Two studies published in 2016 suggest that treatment with psilocybin can produce significant and lasting improvements in depression and anxiety for cancer patients.

'I'm so scared and angry'

TheraPsil has helped the four cancer patients file Section Section 56 applications under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to obtain psilocybin. The law gives the health minister the power to grant access to illegal drugs when ""necessary for a medical or scientific purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.""

In a video filmed by TheraPsil, Laurie Brooks, an Abbotsford nurse and mother of four, describes the feelings she's experienced since learning her cancer is terminal.

""I'm so scared and angry, and I feel guilty and ashamed that I'm putting my family through this,"" she tells the camera.

Brooks, who was not available for an interview with CBC, says she learned about the potential therapeutic uses of psilocybin from a documentary, and she was struck by a fellow cancer patient who ""looked so peaceful"" after receiving the drug.

Laurie Brooks is one of four Canadians dying of cancer who've applied for the right to try psilocybin to treat their end-of-life distress. (TheraPsil)

The patients have yet to receive a response. A Health Canada spokesperson said in an email that she was unable to comment on individual applications, but the length of each review depends on the complexity of the case and the completeness of the application.

""The Government of Canada has great empathy for individuals living with a terminal illness and their needs for care and treatment. Health Canada is committed to carefully and thoroughly reviewing each ... request relating to psilocybin on a case-by-case basis,"" the spokesperson said.

Health Canada also has a special access program that allows practitioners to request access to drugs that aren't currently available in this country ""for treating patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable or are unavailable.""

""It would seem that that program was tailor made for both psilocybin and for the patients that we seek to treat,"" Tobin said.

But restricted drugs like psilocybin aren't available through the program, a stipulation that Tobin describes as ""arbitrary and unscientific.""

Previous application rejected

Three years ago, Tobin applied for a more sweeping exemption from Canadian law that would allow him to use psilocybin to treat any terminal cancer patient suffering from end-of-life distress so severe it interferes with other medical treatments and that hasn't responded to other available therapies.

Health Canada rejected his application in a letter on March 3, saying that there is ""insufficient evidence"" to support an exemption, and that ""psilocybin can be accessed through other means"" — specifically, through clinical trials.

Tobin disagrees with that assessment and plans to officially dispute it.

He points to a 2015 decision from the Supreme Court of Canada that struck down restrictions on the use of non-dried forms of medical cannabis.

That judgment states that ""by forcing a person to choose between a legal but inadequate treatment and an illegal but more effective one, the law ... infringes security of the person.""

Tobin remains hopeful that the federal government will grant the patients' requests for psilocybin, but if it doesn't happen, TheraPsil plans to file a constitutional challenge.

""I'm going to be saddened to see my government's health minister be in a position of denying dying people something that there's evidence to show could be helpful for them,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/4-dying-canadians-wait-to-hear-if-they-ll-be-allowed-to-try-magic-mushrooms-for-their-anguish-1.5653083,news,canada,british-columbia

It is not known whether any formal complaint has been filed.

Ahead of a Sunday news conference where Blanchet is expected to address the matter, all members of the Bloc caucus released a statement backing their leader.

Hamilton's latest victory from pole position was as comfortable as the nearly 9-second margin over second-place Max Verstappen suggested. The British driver's 86th GP win moved him just five behind the German great Schumacher's F1 record of 91.

Schumacher won the French GP eight times when it was held at Magny-Cours. Hamilton first won here in 2007 and his first success with Mercedes also came at the Hungaroring track in 2013, the year after replacing Schumacher on the Silver Arrows team.

Verstappen drove superbly to hold off Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who finished less than one second behind him in third to relinquish the championship lead after three races.

Hamilton took a record-extending 90th career pole on Saturday to match Schumacher's record for seven poles on the 4.4-kilometre track nestled among rolling hills outside of Budapest.

He made a clean start but Bottas made a poor one from second and was overtaken by Lance Stroll starting third; the Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc, and Verstappen from seventh.

Red Bull only just managed to get Verstappen's car on the grid for the start. About 20 minutes earlier, he damaged the front wing when going over a kerb and sliding into the barriers on a warmup lap.

Team principal Christian Horner looked on anxiously as mechanics replaced it and repaired the suspension, working frantically fast to get his car ready. They did, with just minutes left.

In a demoralizing sign of the times for Ferrari, both cars were lapped by Hamilton.

""To my knowledge, as things stand there is nothing that directly links my client to the cathedral fire. I'd like to remind everyone of the presumption of innocence for my client,"" lawyer Quentin Chabert told reporters on Sunday.

He also said that ""politicians are meddling in the situation,"" and that should not prevent a sense of perspective over a fire that had not endangered human life, although it caused significant damage.

The blaze destroyed stained-glass windows and the cathedral's grand organ.

The man, who was not named, worked as a volunteer for the cathedral and had been in charge of locking up the building on Friday night, LCI television said, citing prosecutor Pierre Sennes.

Sennes said the man was being held to clear up inconsistencies in his schedule.

On Saturday, he said three fires had been started at the site, and there had been no signs of a break-in. Authorities said an investigation for suspected arson had been opened.

The cathedral's rector, Rev. Hubert Champenois, told BFM TV that the man in custody had worked for several years at the cathedral and he trusted him completely.

24852,2020-07-19 11:06,"Fake cheers, air-5s, loud HR by masked player highlight 1st COVID-era MLB exhibitions","Didi Gregorius watched over the top of his face mask as his drive off Washington ace Max Scherzer sailed into empty outfield seats.

Fake cheers, meant to encourage the hometown Nationals -- accidentally piped through the stadium as the Philadelphia Phillies shortstop rounded the bases. After touching home plate, he pantomimed air-fives to teammates.

""This is 2020 baseball,"" Scherzer said. ""Embrace it and have fun with it.""

Exhibition games in Washington, New York and Pittsburgh on Saturday gave Major League Baseball its first look at coronavirus-era games — cardboard cutouts for fans, sound effects for crowds and more. Still, for clubs limited to practices and intrasquads in their own ballparks for the past two weeks, Saturday stood as an important mile marker as the sport tries to start a shortened 60-game season next Thursday amid a pandemic.

""In some ways, this is very much a dress rehearsal for the new world we're in,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before an exhibition at the crosstown Mets.

No fans rushed off the 7 train in Flushing at Citi Field, and no masses hurried over the Clemente Bridge in Pittsburgh — not with MLB planning to start this pandemic-shaken season at empty stadiums. At Nationals Park, several people watched from a building balcony far beyond the left field wall.

Umpires wore face masks, as did some players. Backups watched from the stands to maintain social distancing in dugouts. They all tried to follow safety protocols, including a ban on licking fingers or spitting.

Another new look — the Mets became the first club to sell ad space on the field itself, spray painting a Ford logo on the back of the pitcher's mound.

Gregorius drilled a three-run homer in the first inning in Washington, the first big fly by a player in any of Saturday's games.

The 30-year-old Phillies newcomer is one of a handful of players who has said he'll wear a mask full-time this season. Gregorius has a chronic kidney disorder that makes him high risk for the coronavirus.

Scherzer is expected to throw the first pitch of the regular season when the Nats host new ace Gerrit Cole and the Yankees on Thursday night. The right-hander struggled in his final tuneup, also allowing a three-run shot to former teammate Bryce Harper.

Booed heartily last season after spurning Washington in free agency, Harper heard no such jeers this time.

For their first exhibition game since the virus outbreak shut down spring training in mid-March, Yankees players took a team bus from the Bronx to Queens to meet the Mets — no subways for this series.

Elbow taps, distanced chats

The pre-game routine looked familiar enough -- soaring batting practice homers from Giancarlo Stanton and Pete Alonso, ground ball work for Gleyber Torres and Robinson Cano.

Signs of the times were certainly there. Some coaches hit fungoes in face masks, and the usual high fives and hugs between opponents around the batting cage were replaced by elbow taps and distanced chats, including one between Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and Mets counterpart Brodie Van Wagenen.

With no fans filing in for first pitch, nearly 1,000 cardboard likenesses of Mets supporters were set up behind home plate. The team plans to have 5,000 in place by opening day.

Reserve players watched from under large awnings build behind both dugouts. Mets backups gave a standing ovation to scheduled starter Rick Porcello as he returned from the bullpen, then started a chant of ""Let's go, Mets!""

The first homer in Flushing also came from a masked player — Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier. The 25-year-old, who says he's taken heat on social media for his decision to wear a face covering at all times, drove a two-run homer into the second deck in the fourth inning.

The Cleveland Indians loaded into three buses Saturday for the two-hour-plus drive to Pittsburgh. Manager Terry Francona said the team adhered to social-distance guidelines — and staggered arrival times — for the team's first trip since camp re-opened.

""I think it's a good experience for all of us,"" he said. ""We're not used to getting on a bus and get your temperature taken and things like that, so it's good to go through that.""

Cleveland made a public show of support for social justice before its 5-3 win, standing with their right hands over their hearts and their left hands on the right shoulder of their teammates during the national anthem.

A few fans gathered outside PNC Park, hoping to catch some sort of game action.

Michael Kirkpatrick, 73, and his son, Zac, stood on the Clemente Bridge beyond centre field — the same place they crammed shoulder to shoulder during the NL wild-card game in 2013. No trouble finding a spot this time.

""I just need to hear a bat hit a ball,"" Zac said.

In Washington, a moment of silence was held for late civil rights trailblazer John Lewis. Players stood socially distanced for the national anthem — an acoustic rendition by the U.S. Army Brass Quintet performed before Game 4 of last year's World Series and replayed on the video scoreboard.

""Definitely has a different feeling to it,"" Nationals centre-fielder Michael A. Taylor said.

24847,2020-07-19 10:57,NHLers say fans can expect some entertaining summer games,"NHL players usually show up for training camp in September after a summer filled with workouts and skating sessions.

They ease into the exhibition schedule — veterans might play half the games — as part of a slow build towards the regular season.

The playoffs and the Stanley Cup are the ultimate goal. Both are also a long way off.

There's inevitably some early rust, and those October matchups can be sloppy, especially before coaches get a chance to really drill down on systems and tendencies.

So in a season like no other, what will the hockey look like after 143 days between meaningful games when the NHL's pandemic-halted campaign resumes Aug. 1 following a chaotic sprint to get ready?

""Fun to watch,"" Toronto Maple Leafs captain John Tavares said. ""Intensity's going to be high, extremely fast-paced. We'll probably see some wild hockey games.""

""Fast and wild,"" added Washington Capitals defenceman John Carlson.

Most players were off skates for two months or more after the league suspended its schedule March 12 because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Some had access home gyms, while others were cooped up in condos without any equipment at their disposal.

NHLers started to trickle back into arenas as different jurisdictions opened in the spring. Clubs were allowed to make facilities available for voluntary on- and off-ice workouts in June.

WATCH | NHL to return August 1 with hub cities in Toronto, Edmonton:

The NHL is officially returning to the ice this summer as the league and its players' union ratified an agreement on Friday. 2:19

After the league and the NHL Players' Association gave the 24-team restart a thumbs up earlier this month, training camps opened July 13. It's then off to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto on July 26 before the mad dash for the Cup begins after just one exhibition game.

""Everyone's had a chance to get away and reflect and get some rest and probably feel a lot better mentally and physically with a long break like this,"" Tavares said. ""We know how fast and talented our league is overall.

""There's not much room for error, so the stakes are high right off the bat.""

Boston Bruins forward Brad Marchand, however, said in April things could look ""really, really ugly"" to start, while Winnipeg Jets sniper Patrik Laine mused in May he might be ""terrible"" after such a long layoff. The Finn hadn't changed his tune a couple of days into camp.

But for the most part, players don't think it will take long for the 24 mostly healthy teams involved in the resumption to find their groove.

""This is a league where you have to prepare,"" Calgary Flames centre Elias Linholm said. ""And if you don't, you're going to be out of the league pretty quick. I think guys have been preparing pretty good. I don't think you need much time on the ice to get back.""

Pittsburgh Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan agreed it shouldn't take the best in the world at their craft to figure things out, especially when considering the stakes.

""These guys are proud guys,"" he said. ""A lot of them see the opportunity in front of them. That drive and that motivation to win a Stanley Cup is going to force players into a quick adjustment process.

""I can assure you this: the competition is going to be fierce. As play starts to resume and the more games guys get under their belt, the quality of execution will continue to improve.""

Vancouver Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev is sure of one thing as well: playing in empty arenas will impact the game.

""The momentum swings will be quite different,"" he said. ""Especially when you don't have fans cheering for you or when you're on the road [and] the rink gets going and the other team can maybe get five or seven minutes of a big momentum swing.""

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas said the unique nature of the situation, including 16 clubs battling in the best-of-five qualifying round for the right to fill out the final eight spots of the usual playoff bracket, will be intriguing.

""There's no experience that anyone's had like this,"" he said. ""You can look at some of the Canada Cups or World Cups for players who come into tournaments on long layoffs. Then again, those are [September] tournaments coming off April, May, June finishes depending on where you were in the standings.

""This is an August resumption after a March ending, so almost a five-month layoff for everyone between games, and just one exhibition game. I really don't have any idea what it's going to look like.""

Toronto centre Auston Matthews also doesn't know what's coming after so much time on the shelf, but he's eager to find out.

""I keep reading that a lot of people feel that this is probably gonna be the hardest Stanley Cup to win with everybody being fresh,"" he said. ""I'm not sure anybody really knows what to expect.

24844,2020-07-19 10:53,"Protests intensify in Portland against police, as Trump says local leaders have 'lost control'","Protesters broke into a building, set it on fire and started dumpster fires late Saturday night in Oregon's largest city, police said, as demonstrations that have been taking place since the death of George Floyd intensified for another night in Portland.

The fire at the Portland Police Association building was put out a short time later, police said on Twitter. The department declared the gathering a riot and began working to clear the downtown area.

""As the crowd was dispersed, several people in the crowd were arrested and officers were able to extinguish the fire. Portland Police did not use any CS gas,"" the bureau said in a statement early Sunday. Several arrests were made.

Tear gas was deployed, according to pictures and video from the scene, but it was not necessarily CS gas. Fencing that had been placed around the federal courthouse had also been removed by protesters and made into barricades, police tweeted.

Police also said protesters had gathered on Saturday evening at the Portland Police Bureau's North Precinct, vandalizing patrol vehicles and taunting officers who were reporting for work. Later, as police dispersed a group that had gathered near North Interstate Avenue, people threw rocks and paint-filled balloons at officers. Some were injured, the statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has decried the demonstrations, and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf blasted the protesters as ""lawless anarchists"" in a visit to the city on Thursday.

We are trying to help Portland, not hurt it. Their leadership has, for months, lost control of the anarchists and agitators. They are missing in action. We must protect Federal property, AND OUR PEOPLE. These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal! —@realDonaldTrump

""We are trying to help Portland, not hurt it,"" Trump tweeted Sunday. ""Their leadership has, for months, lost control of the anarchists and agitators. They are missing in action. We must protect Federal property, AND OUR PEOPLE. These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal!""

Local politicians angry with troop deployment

Before the aggressive language and action from federal officials, the unrest had frustrated Mayor Ted Wheeler and other local authorities, who had said a small cadre of violent activists were drowning out the message of peaceful protesters in the city. But Wheeler said the federal presence in the city is now exacerbating a tense situation, and he has told them to depart.

""Keep your troops in your own buildings, or have them leave our city,"" Wheeler said Friday.

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum late Friday sued Homeland Security and the Marshals Service in federal court. The complaint said unidentified federal agents have grabbed people off Portland's streets ""without warning or explanation, without a warrant, and without providing any way to determine who is directing this action.""

(Dave Killen/The Oregonian via The Associated Press)

Rosenblum said she was seeking a temporary restraining order to ""immediately stop federal authorities from unlawfully detaining Oregonians.""

The administration has enlisted federal agents, including the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and an elite U.S. Customs and Border Protection team based on the U.S.-Mexico border, to protect federal property.

But Oregon Public Broadcasting reported this week that some agents had been driving around in unmarked vans and snatching protesters from streets not near federal property, without identifying themselves.

Tensions also escalated after an officer with the Marshals Service fired a less-lethal round at a protester's head on July 11, critically injuring him.

'We live in a democracy, not a banana republic'

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer issued a joint statement Saturday denouncing the Trump administration's actions.

""We live in a democracy, not a banana republic. We will not tolerate the use of Oregonians, Washingtonians — or any other Americans — as props in President Trump's political games. The House is committed to moving swiftly to curb these egregious abuses of power immediately,"" they said.

Hundreds of people had gathered Friday night for a vigil outside the downtown Justice Center, which is sandwiched between two federal buildings, including a courthouse, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Across the street, dozens of other protesters entered two recently closed city parks after dismantling chain-link fencing that blocked access.

Federal agents emerged from an office building next door and used impact munitions, stun grenades and tear gas to clear the area, the news organization reported. It said its journalists did not observe any incident that might have prompted the use of the weapons.

Federal officers deployed tear gas again just before midnight after a few protesters placed dismantled fencing in front of plywood doors covering the entrance of the federal courthouse.

Early Saturday, Portland police declared the gathering unlawful, saying protesters had piled fencing in front of the exits to the federal courthouse and the Multnomah County Justice Center and then shot off fireworks at the Justice Center.

Federal officers and local police then advanced simultaneously on the demonstrators to clear the streets, making arrests as protesters threw bottles and pieces of metal fence at police, the Portland Police Bureau said. Portland police Chief Chuck Lovell told reporters Friday that his officers are in contact with the federal agents but that neither controls the others' actions.

The overnight action by Portland's police was condemned by Jo Ann Hardesty, a prominent member of city council. Hardesty said Saturday that local police ""joined in the aggressive clampdown of peaceful protest.""

She also slammed Wheeler, telling the mayor he needed to better control local law enforcement. Hardesty, who oversees the city's fire department and other first-responder agencies, said in an open letter to Wheeler that if ""you can't control the police, give me the Portland Police Bureau.""

In a statement Saturday, Portland Police said as they responded to the overnight protests — which included people throwing projectiles at them — some federal agencies took action ""under their own supervision and direction."" Portland Police said city officers arrested seven people, and one officer sustained a minor injury.

24858,2020-07-19 10:15,Shreds from the sea: 300-year-old shipwreck finds new life in electric guitars,"Greg Fleming built his Tidebreaker guitars using wood from a shipwreck found in Renews Harbour, on the southeast coast of Newfoundland. The wood dates to 1661. (Submitted by Greg Fleming)

St. John's musician Greg Fleming has seen a lot of guitars made out of a lot of different materials.

But after experimenting with creating guitars from an unlikely source, he says he hasn't come across anything like his first creation.

""I've got Gibsons and Fenders and all sorts of guitars, and these Tidebreakers are completely different than all of it,"" Fleming told CBC Radio's Weekend AM. ""They're very unique.""

Fleming's Tidebreaker guitar was created with wood from a shipwreck found in Renews Harbour, on the southeast coast of Newfoundland. When the wood was found in 1994, he said, those in the community knew they had come across something special.

""The wood was very interesting because it wasn't put together with steel. It was put together with what's called tree nails,"" he said. ""And because of that, I decided to get the wood carbon-dated.""

Working with the University of Ottawa, Fleming discovered the sunken timbers dated from 1661. At some point, they wound up on the ocean floor until 1994, when the wood was moved to a field on Fleming's uncle's property in Renews, on the southern shore of the Avalon peninsula. There they sat for another 25 years.

After Fleming decided to start making electric guitars early last year, the wood became the inspiration for his first set of custom instruments.

The wood used to make the guitars must be slowly dried before it can be cut open, which led Fleming to discover the wood was infused with salt water. (Submitted by Greg Fleming)

""I decided to cut [the boards of wood] open and I dried them out,"" he said. ""Once I split them open and saw how the wood properties changed and how the wood infused with the seawater after being underwater for about 300 years, I knew then and there it had to be a guitar.

""I had some preconceived notions of what I was going to do with the wood,"" Fleming said. ""But when you open the wood and make an initial cut and look at it, it really tells a different story and you kind of get inspired. [You] sort of tailor it to what that artistic piece of wood looks like.""

Fleming's process usually takes two to three months, as the fragile wood needs to be slowly dried before it can be used. After experimenting with the salt water-infused wood, he said, the guitar has surpassed all expectations, providing a unique sound unlike anything else in his collection.

Fleming has completed two Tidebreaker guitars and is working on a third. He hopes to make a series of 10. (Submitted by Greg Fleming)

""This wood is absolutely phenomenal,"" he said. ""The guitars are solid, they're two or three pieces. They don't have a separate top, there's solid wood throughout.... It's got incredible sustain, and that gives it a really toney volume.""

Fleming hopes to complete a limited series of 10 guitars with the wood he has left, but he won't be sure how much wood is usable until he cuts into it. He said he might end up selling a few of the guitars in hopes of sharing the feel, sound and history of the instruments.

""It's truly remarkable when I look at what this wood looked like in a field, to a finished instrument,"" he said. ""So every time, I kind of get a little bit of chills when I realize I'm playing a shipwreck that was underwater for 300 years.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/greg-fleming-shipwreck-guitars-1.5652689?cmp=rss,news,canada,newfoundland-labrador

The celebration of the couple's 70th anniversary took place in their hometown of Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., at the Church of Our Lady of Good Hope.

""It was really beautiful, they were so cute,"" said daughter Rose McNeely.

The Kochons were married in Fort Good Hope in 1950 and still live on the land, McNeely said.

She said her father, who is 91, is still very active.

""He seems like he's about 70,"" she said. ""He still goes hunting, sets snares and he is really active,"" said McNeely. ""He's all over the community — right from the time he gets up in the morning until in the evening.""

Sarah has some trouble walking now due to a knee operation.

""She's in a wheelchair, but still does her exercises,"" McNeely said.

She said the celebration had a couple of humorous moments in it. For one, both Gabe and Sarah dozed off during the ceremony, she said.

""I had to go up and give her a push and made a sound to dad [to wake them up],"" she laughed. ""I said, 'It's time to say your vows' … It was comical.""

Sarah also had trouble picking out a dress for the anniversary which made them a little late for the celebration, McNeely said

She said at the feast after the ceremony, Gabe, who is known for his humour, recounted the dress distress and had everyone laughing.

""We couldn't stop laughing.""

McNeely said it was great to see the two of them renew their vows in their own language and to have so many in the community come out and celebrate.

""They taught us a lot, my parents, as we were growing up,"" she said.

And their relationship is still strong.

""They work together,"" McNeely said. ""And if they get in a little argument, he will then make up to her. He will cater to her.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/wedding-anniversary-fort-good-hope-1.5653067?cmp=rss,news,canada,north
24943,2020-07-19 10:00,Edmonton photography studio and advocates create new project to honour MMIWG in Canada,"An Edmonton photography studio has created a new tribute to memorialize and call attention toward missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.

This initiative, called Project Change, was created to honour missing women and girls in Canada, an issue that hasn't been given enough attention said project creator Shawna Serniak.

The project was created last year, Serniak said, with the goal of not just awareness but also to create roadside memorials.

""As a Métis woman, I feel that in Canada here there's a high number of murdered and missing Indigenous women and children, as well as men,"" said Serniak, founder of Every Woman Empowered, a local organization that offers workshops, conferences and a community based on self-development.

""We're not seeing enough being done to start to address this concern, as well as do something as a society about it to make sure that we can stop the numbers from growing.""

A local photography studio has created powerful images to help memorialize Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. We'll hear more about Project Change. 7:09

Serniak was interviewed on Edmonton AM, earlier this week.

Serniak teamed up on this project with local studio Visions of Heaphen Photography and their artist, Heather Fryer. The project offers a series of limited edition prints that are being sold to raise funds for a memorial plaque program.

The prints can be found at the Old Strathcona Arts Emporium in central Edmonton.

The prints are a composite mixing digital art and photographs, showing characters with a sense of sorrow and loss, while showing they're strong and proud as well, said studio co-owner Steve Fryer.

""I can't imagine losing somebody the way some of these people have lost their children,"" Steve Fryer said.





Once enough money is raised, Serniak said her project will work with another charity to build the actual monuments for roadside or park memorials.

She said they also want to work with affected families about where they would like the memorials to be placed.

Serniak said she expects the project will take a few years to come to fruition, and that she wants to expand this plan to see more memorials built across the country after starting in Alberta.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-photography-studio-and-advocates-create-new-project-to-honour-mmiwg-in-canada-1.5654065?cmp=rss,news,canada,edmonton
24838,2020-07-19 9:07,Germany's Merkel warns of summit failure on EU coronavirus recovery fund,"European Union leaders toiled in search of a coronavirus stimulus deal for a third day on Sunday but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the mounting acrimony over the level of spending might not easily be overcome.

Germany and France, the EU's powerbrokers, are seeking a deal on a 1.8 trillion euro ($2.8 trillion Cdn) economic recovery package to rescue the bloc's economies that are facing their worst recession since the Second World War.

Sticking points are the size of the new recovery fund and what proportion should be in grants and loans, with some ""frugal"" richer states led by the Netherlands pushing to limit it, underscoring the depth of the EU's north-south split.

Separately, the summit faces difficulties in agreeing the scale of EU budget rebates for richer countries, as well as a dispute over a proposed new rule of law mechanism, which could freeze EU funding to countries flouting democratic principles.

Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose country was only just recovering from its 10-year debt crisis when the pandemic hit, made a plea for unity, saying the EU could not afford to look ""divided or weak.""

""I sincerely hope that today we can break the deadlock,"" he told reporters as he arrived at the Europa building in Brussels.

Leaders wearing face masks have called the summit a 'make-or-break' moment for nearly 70 years of European integration and failure to agree amid an unprecedented health and economic crisis would raise serious questions about the viability of the bloc, officials and experts say.

""There is a lot of goodwill, but also many positions. I will make every effort but it is possible that there is no result,"" Merkel said.

Speculation was rife among EU diplomats that talks could run into Monday and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he was willing to stay in Brussels all week, but another summit later in July was more likely in the event of no deal.

With consultations going on, the formal start of the summit plenary with all 27 leaders was delayed indefinitely.

Political bickering

Late on Saturday, Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron left the day's final stretch of informal talks early, refusing to accept that the level of free grants to ailing economies in the package fall below 400 billion euros ($620.5 billion Cdn).

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had earlier accused the Netherlands and its allies Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Finland of ""blackmail."" Stockholm proposes to cut grants to 155 billion euros ($240 billion Cdn).

Macron said there was a willingness to compromise, but it should not deter ""from the legitimate ambition that we need to have,"" referring to the level of money available in the planned 750 billion euros ($1.1 trillion Cdn) recovery fund, which is to be funded by money raised on capital markets.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who faces parliamentary elections by March 2021, was frank about the divisions with France and Germany on Saturday night. ""They walked away annoyed,"" Rutte said of Merkel and Macron.

Meanwhile, Hungary, backed by its eurosceptic ally Poland, has threatened to veto the package over the rule of law mechanism, supported by the Dutch.

Orban said Rutte had a personal grudge against him. Rutte's office was not immediately available for comment.

""I don't know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary, but he is attacking so harshly ... I don't like blame games but the Dutchman is the real responsible man for the whole mess,"" Orban told reporters.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/europe-coronavirus-economy-eu-finance-meeting-1.5655217?cmp=rss,news,world,
24839,2020-07-19 9:02,"Toronto asking for additional measures for restaurant, bars, indoor dining ahead of Stage 3 reopening","Toronto's Mayor is asking the province to implement additional measures to bars, restaurants and indoor dining settings ahead of any Stage 3 reopening in the city, saying he is worried about a second wave.

In a letter to Premier Doug Ford, Mayor John Tory presented six changes that he hopes will be put in place quickly, including early closure times, further physical distancing restrictions and requiring customers to stay seated at all times.

""I know Premier Ford is just as concerned as I am about a second wave and the disastrous impact that a return to a more stringent lockdown would have on the health of our residents and the restart of the Ontario economy,"" said Tory in a statement on Saturday.

""We have seen in other jurisdictions that further reopening can lead to increased outbreaks of COVID-19 and growing case count numbers. We do not want to go in that direction.""

Tory said he hopes the province will make amendments to the province's Stage 3 order that will apply, at least, to the City of Toronto.

The six changes are:

Requiring customers of indoor food and drink establishments to be seated at all times unless walking in or out, going to the washroom or paying the bill. The present requirement applies only while people are actually eating or drinking.

Requiring restaurant and bar operators to keep a customer log with a name and contact information along with the date, check in and check out times, and table number for 30 days. Right now, this is only a Toronto Public Health recommendation not a provincial requirement.

Implementing additional capacity restrictions for food and drink establishments that limit occupancy to ensure that physical distancing can be easily maintained by all patrons. Right now, there is no cap provided distancing can be maintained.

Implementing early closure times for food and drink establishments for at least an initial period of time, similar to what has been done in Quebec.

Requiring establishments to implement COVID-19 screening protocols for staff, such as completion of a screening questionnaire, prior to the commencement of their shifts.

Outlining clear mandatory face covering requirements for staff and patrons of bars and restaurants in the amended Stage 3 order.

The city said these establishments present a high level of risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus and by implementing additional measures, will ensure public health and safety as the city prepares to move into Stage 3 of reopening.

This comes after a number of bars and restaurants made headlines for not maintaining physical distancing in their establishments.

Last week, the Ontario Medical Association urged the Ford government to rethink allowing bars to resume serving customers indoors, saying that bars have been shown to fuel the spread of the virus.

COVID-19 is putting a dent in many short-term rental markets

Since the pandemic officially began in March, many short-term rental operators have been forced to think on their feet. Some have moved to list their properties as long-term rentals, while others have sold their homes altogether and cut their losses.

In Toronto, Canada's most visited city, bookings are down dramatically, but in Ontario's Prince Edward County — just three hours away — bookings are actually up since April. That's good news for tourism but worrying for some residents now having trouble finding places to live year round.

Watch | How the pandemic is impacting short-term rentals in communities small and large:

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot more empty short-term rentals in Toronto, while three hours away in Prince Edward County bookings are on the rise and both scenarios are creating challenges for tenants looking for somewhere to live long term. 4:54

Donations to health charities are way down

Some of the country's biggest charities are hurting this year, as lucrative in-person events like Run for the Cure are cancelled due to the pandemic, and online alternatives fail to bring in the same kind of money.



The Health Charities Coalition of Canada says revenues have fallen more than 50 per cent this year, leading to delays in disease research and less support for people in need. Read more about why donations have fallen.

Events like the annual Run for the Cure in support of the Canadian Cancer Society bring out thousands of participants in cities across country, like this one last year in Vancouver. Such fundraisers have switched to virtual events this year because of physical distancing requirements. (CBC)

24840,2020-07-19 9:00,4 dying Canadians wait to hear if they'll be allowed to try magic mushrooms for their anguish,"It's been about three months since four dying Canadians filed applications with the federal government asking for the right to try magic mushrooms to treat the psychological distress that comes with facing the end of their lives.

The psychedelic fungi have shown promise in relieving some of the anxiety and depression faced by those suffering with terminal cancer, but the active ingredient psilocybin is still undergoing clinical trials.

Victoria psychotherapist Bruce Tobin, founder of the advocacy group TheraPsil, says completing those trials is absolutely necessary before magic mushrooms can be made widely available.

But he believes terminally ill patients deserve compassionate access to something that might help with their anguish when other treatments have failed.

""Canadian society now acknowledges that citizens have the right to die,"" Tobin told CBC News, referring to the legalization of medical assistance in dying.

""How is it that we're going to allow them to die when they affirm that their lives are intolerable, but we won't acknowledge their right to try something that could allow them to continue their life in a meaningful way?""

Research is currently underway to determine if psilocybin is safe and effective to treat things like depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and substance use disorder. Two studies published in 2016 suggest that treatment with psilocybin can produce significant and lasting improvements in depression and anxiety for cancer patients.

'I'm so scared and angry'

TheraPsil has helped the four cancer patients file Section Section 56 applications under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to obtain psilocybin. The law gives the health minister the power to grant access to illegal drugs when ""necessary for a medical or scientific purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.""

In a video filmed by TheraPsil, Laurie Brooks, an Abbotsford nurse and mother of four, describes the feelings she's experienced since learning her cancer is terminal.

""I'm so scared and angry, and I feel guilty and ashamed that I'm putting my family through this,"" she tells the camera.

Brooks, who was not available for an interview with CBC, says she learned about the potential therapeutic uses of psilocybin from a documentary, and she was struck by a fellow cancer patient who ""looked so peaceful"" after receiving the drug.

Laurie Brooks is one of four Canadians dying of cancer who've applied for the right to try psilocybin to treat their end-of-life distress. (TheraPsil)

The patients have yet to receive a response. A Health Canada spokesperson said in an email that she was unable to comment on individual applications, but the length of each review depends on the complexity of the case and the completeness of the application.

""The Government of Canada has great empathy for individuals living with a terminal illness and their needs for care and treatment. Health Canada is committed to carefully and thoroughly reviewing each ... request relating to psilocybin on a case-by-case basis,"" the spokesperson said.

Health Canada also has a special access program that allows practitioners to request access to drugs that aren't currently available in this country ""for treating patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable or are unavailable.""

""It would seem that that program was tailor made for both psilocybin and for the patients that we seek to treat,"" Tobin said.

But restricted drugs like psilocybin aren't available through the program, a stipulation that Tobin describes as ""arbitrary and unscientific.""

Previous application rejected

Three years ago, Tobin applied for a more sweeping exemption from Canadian law that would allow him to use psilocybin to treat any terminal cancer patient suffering from end-of-life distress so severe it interferes with other medical treatments and that hasn't responded to other available therapies.

Health Canada rejected his application in a letter on March 3, saying that there is ""insufficient evidence"" to support an exemption, and that ""psilocybin can be accessed through other means"" — specifically, through clinical trials.

Tobin disagrees with that assessment and plans to officially dispute it.

He points to a 2015 decision from the Supreme Court of Canada that struck down restrictions on the use of non-dried forms of medical cannabis.

That judgment states that ""by forcing a person to choose between a legal but inadequate treatment and an illegal but more effective one, the law ... infringes security of the person.""

Tobin remains hopeful that the federal government will grant the patients' requests for psilocybin, but if it doesn't happen, TheraPsil plans to file a constitutional challenge.

""I'm going to be saddened to see my government's health minister be in a position of denying dying people something that there's evidence to show could be helpful for them,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/4-dying-canadians-wait-to-hear-if-they-ll-be-allowed-to-try-magic-mushrooms-for-their-anguish-1.5653083?cmp=rss,news,canada,british-columbia
24944,2020-07-19 8:47,Kenora-area First Nations say city's loitering bylaw discriminates against homeless,"First Nations advocates are calling on the City of Kenora in Ontario to reject a proposed loitering bylaw, which they worry will unfairly target transient and homeless people, many of whom are Indigenous.

The draft bylaw would give police officers authority to ticket anyone found loitering on public property, and tickets carry a fine of $100.

Nishnawbe Aski Nation and Grand Council Treaty 3, two political organizations that represent First Nations in the area, worry it will negatively affect people from the First Nations they oversee, according to a joint news release issued on Friday.

""It's absolutely ridiculous. My opinion right off the bat is that [the bylaw] is draconian and racist,"" Derek Fox, the deputy grand chief of Nishnawbe Aksi Nation said in an interview.

Both organizations are calling on city council to reject the bylaw, and offered help addressing the issues that lead to homelessness in the city, which is about 190 kilometres east of Winnipeg.

""It is critical that these issues are addressed collectively by all those that share the land of the Anishinaabe Nation,"" the news release says.

Kenora city council met to discuss the bylaw on Tuesday, and although members acknowledged the bylaw won't fix underlying causes of homelessness, they said they can't wait for other levels of government to act.

""We have yet to see anything from them and we need to act for our constituents [and] for our community,"" according to minutes from the meeting.

""It is recognized that this is not going to fix and solve the complex issues but it will assist with some concerns that the municipality continues to receive.""

City council is scheduled to vote on the bylaw on Tuesday.

A 2019 report by the Ontario Human Rights Commission found about 95 per cent of people experiencing homelessness in Kenora identify as First Nations.

The commission found the success of social programs addressing homelessness and addictions was ""hindered by a lack of effective communication between government agencies and the Indigenous-led organizations that provide services on the ground, as well as systemic issues related to housing and social services.""

The report suggested the City of Kenora and the district services board develop better communication with local Indigenous service agencies and First Nations leaders and community members.

""This will ensure that the needs of service users are accurately identified and appropriately met.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kenora-loitering-bylaw-discrimination-1.5655123?cmp=rss,news,canada,manitoba
24836,2020-07-19 8:00,Memoir by women's advocate and community planner Elaine Alec a story of survival and transformation,"Elaine Alec (Syilx-Secwepemc) has made a career of working with First Nations across the country to build stronger communities and organizations.

She'd long wanted to write a book that could inform other planners working with Indigenous Peoples but it was her recent community work, focused on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, that inspired her to start writing again.

Alec's debut book — a memoir titled Calling My Spirit Back — is a personal story of survival and transformation. It's also an account of intergenerational trauma, the hard work that goes into healing and breaking cycles, and how the teachings of a nation and lived experiences can be channeled into work that can heal and strengthen communities.

For a long time, Alec said she didn't see herself as a survivor, even as she was living through the chaos of intergenerational trauma and addictions.

""I didn't think I was a survivor of anything because it was happening all around me. It was just so normalized my entire life. I was just making it, just like everybody else,"" she said.

In disclosing some of the deeply painful experiences in her life — sexual abuse, violence, racism, heartbreak — Alec lays bare the parts of her story she's carried deep shame about, in particular about the ""type of mother"" she was to her first son, who she gave birth to when she was 18.

""There were times when I wanted to hold back and not talk about things,"" she said.

""But I knew there were other people that were going through that and if I could go through those things and still forgive myself, if I could go through those things and not continue to feel ashamed about that — that they could also forgive themselves and move forward.""

Erasing shame

When asked who her book is for, she said young women living through similar experiences are top of mind.

That wasn't the audience she initially intended to write for but as she was working on her book, she shared her story with a young woman who later told Alec it inspired her to leave an abusive relationship and find a renewed confidence in the goals she'd set for herself.

""That totally changed the way I wanted to put this book out,"" she said.

""I decided at that moment that I want more young women like her, who want to work towards a better life, who feel alone, who might be struggling.""

In her book she writes, ""Every time someone shares their story they help erase the shame for others.""

Alec said she remembers being drawn to books about Buddhism when she was looking for resources early in her sobriety. They reminded her of the teachings from her tema [grandmother].

She then started connecting with Mexican author Don Miguel Ruiz's work and noticed how he was sharing Toltec teachings in his writing. She thought about what she'd been taught and how they could ""contribute to people reaching out and wanting to find ways to move through their healing, move through their trauma,"" she said.

Putting teachings into professional practice

Knit throughout her memoir are teachings Alec learned from family, mentors and her nation.

She explains how she uses that knowledge and her spirituality as the foundation of her professional work as an Indigenous community planner. At the core of her work is employing a Syilx approach to planning and decision making, ensuring protocols and agreements are put into place to cultivate a safe space for people to work together.

She explains how creating safe spaces is crucial in her work, recalling the community sessions she did talking about missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and putting together action plans.

The Sûreté du Québec announced Saturday night they were ""adjusting"" their strategy after ten days of combing through the forests around Saint-Apollinaire, Que., 40 kilometres southwest of Quebec City.

In a statement, the SQ said it had finished going through all the information it had about Carpentier's possible whereabouts in that area.

""We are looking into new information, allowing us to redeploy our resources in other areas,"" the statement said.

""Parallel to this, other investigative steps are under way. We won't elaborate on their nature so as not to hinder their effectiveness.""

Police have been looking for Carpentier since he disappeared with his two young daughters following a car crash near Quebec City on July 8.

The lifeless bodies of Norah, 11, and Romy, six, were discovered three days later.

In the statement, police said that while scouring the Saint-Apollinaire area they chased down more than 1,000 tips sent in from the public, and searched around 700 houses, cottages, RVs, barns and sheds.

A funeral for Norah and Romy will be held Monday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/carpentier-ground-search-ends-1.5655213?cmp=rss,news,canada,montreal

Russia rejects allegations it sought to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine.

WHO reported a single-day record of new infections on Saturday with 259,848.

Global death toll from the virus surges past 600,000.

Canada has 109,995 coronavirus infections, including 96,819 recoveries, 8,882 deaths.

Wearing a mask is mandatory in Quebec as of Saturday.

How close are we to a vaccine for COVID-19?

Countries from the U.S. to South Africa to India were struggling to hold down rising rates of the coronavirus, as global deaths from COVID-19 surged past 600,000 in a sign of how far off the world remains from a return to normalcy.

While the U.S. leads global infections, South Africa now ranks as the fifth worst-hit country in the pandemic with 350,879 cases — roughly half of all those confirmed on the African continent. Its struggles are a sign of trouble to come for nations with even fewer health care resources.

The World Health Organization on Saturday again reported a single-day record of new infections with 259,848.

Global COVID-19 deaths have hit 601,549, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The United States tops the list with 140,119 deaths, followed by 78,772 in Brazil and 45,358 in the United Kingdom and 38,888 in Mexico, where a surge in cases have frustrated plans to reopen the economy.

The number of confirmed infections worldwide has passed 14.2 million, out of which 3.7 million are in the United States. There are over 2 million in Brazil and more than 1 million in India. Experts believe the true numbers around the world are higher because of testing shortages and data collection issues in some nations.

Scientists, meanwhile, poured cold water on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's hope that the country may return to normal by Christmas, saying that, without a vaccine, normal life was a long way off.

In a separate development, Russia's ambassador to Britain has rejected allegations that his country's intelligence services sought to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine.

Andrei Kelin said in a BBC interview broadcast Sunday that there was ""no sense"" in the allegations made last week by the United States, Britain and Canada.

""I don't believe in this story at all, there is no sense in it,"" he said when asked about the allegations. ""I learned about their (the hackers) existence from British media. In this world, to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country, it is impossible.""

WATCH | COVID-19 research targeted by hackers:

Marcus Kolga, senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, says Russia may be deploying hackers to try to steal a potential COVID-19 vaccine for its own citizens, as well hinder Western countries' efforts to develop one. 1:21

Intelligence agencies in the U.S., Britain and Canada on Thursday accused the hacking group APT29 — also known as Cozy Bear and believed to be part of Russian intelligence — of using malicious software to attack academic and pharmaceutical research institutions involved in COVID-19 vaccine development. It was unclear whether any useful information was stolen.

What's happening with coronavirus in Canada

The federal government has said it's not OK for the Blue Jays to play ball in Toronto during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ottawa informed the team of the decision on Saturday, citing concerns over the public health risks associated with Major League Baseball's plan for a 60-game season.

Marco Mendicino, minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, told CBC News Network that the circumstances did not warrant a border-crossing exemption, particularly in light of the amount of cross-border travel needed and the risks that remained. The plan called for the Blue Jays and visiting teams to cross the Canada-U.S. border regularly.

A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,881, lower than Friday because Ontario retracted a reported death.

Ontario added 166 new cases on Saturday for a total of 37,440. The province also logged 132 new recoveries for a total of 33,294.

Quebec announced on Saturday that masks are now mandatory in indoor public spaces across the province. The new measure is kicking in as the province witnesses a slow but steady increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

""It's better to wear a mask than to be confined at home,"" Premier François Legault said as he made the announcement last Monday. ""It's not fun wearing a mask, but it's essential.""

The new directive, which applies to people aged 12 and older, coincided with tens of thousands of Quebecers spanning out on vacation with the beginning of the traditional two-week construction holiday.

Here's what's happening around the world

In the U.S., infections are soaring in U.S. states like Florida, Texas, Arizona, fuelled by the haphazard lifting of lockdowns and the resistance of some Americans to wearing masks.

Teams of military medics have been deployed in Texas and California to help hospitals deal with a deluge of patients who are flooding emergency rooms in parts of the U.S. Some patients are being moved into hallways to make room for the most seriously ill and nurses are working extra shifts to keep up with the surge.

Patients struggling to breathe are being placed on ventilators in emergency wards since intensive care units are full, officials say. Patients are waiting ""hours and hours"" to get admitted, said Dr. Alison Haddock of the Baylor College of Medicine in the state of Texas, which reported a new daily record for virus deaths Friday and more than 10,000 confirmed cases for the fourth consecutive day.

More than 80 infants have tested positive for the virus in the state. ""I've never seen anything like this COVID surge,"" said Haddock, who has worked in emergency rooms since 2007. ""We're doing our best, but we're not an ICU.""

The surge of infections means that millions of American children are unlikely to return to classrooms full time in the fall.

India on Sunday reported a 24-hour record surge of 38,902 new cases, taking the country's total to 1,077,618. Elsewhere in Asia, China confirmed 13 new cases in the northwestern city of Urumqi while South Korea reported less than 40 additional cases for a second straight day.

China's capital Beijing will lower the emergency response level of the coronavirus outbreak to Level III from level II, an official from the municipal government told a press briefing on Sunday. The city issued the second level response on June 16 after several infections of the new coronavirus were found to be linked to a major wholesale food market.

Syrians headed to polling stations in government-held parts of the war-torn country on Sunday to elect a new parliament amid strict health measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus amid an increase of cases in recent days.

The vote is the third to take place in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011. It has killed more than 400,000, displaced half the country's population and sent more than five million as refugees mostly into neighbouring countries. As in previous votes in Syria, the vote will produce a rubber-stamp body loyal to the president.

In Australia, after a one-day respite, COVID-19 cases in the state of Victoria rose again, prompting a move to make masks mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne and the nearby shire of Mitchell.
