25581,2020-07-25 22:32,"Calgary's Tesho Akindele scores Orlando City's winner, knocks Impact out of MLS tournament","Canadian international Tesho Akindele scored in the 60th minute and Orlando City advanced to the quarter-finals of the MLS is Back tournament with a 1-0 victory over the Montreal Impact on Saturday night.

Montreal was eliminated with the loss to open the knockout round of the World Cup-style tournament at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex at Walt Disney World.

Orlando will play the winner of Monday night's clash between the defending league champion Seattle Sounders and LAFC in the quarter-finals on Friday.

Orlando City dominated possession in the opening half but couldn't score. Jhegson Mendez appeared to break through with a goal late in the half, but it was ruled offside in the buildup.

Mendez also had a good opportunity in the 38th minute, but his shot from the centre of the box was stopped by Montreal goalkeeper Clement Diop.

Akindele finally got Orlando on the scoreboard. Apparent miscommunication between Diop and defender Rod Fanni allowed Akindele to dash forward and easily slot the goal.

With group stage matches counting toward the regular season, the Impact are 2-2-1 this season under new coach Thierry Henry.

Montreal was a third-place finisher in its group, but secured a spot among the 16 teams in the knockout rounds with a 1-0 victory over D.C. United on Tuesday. Saphir Tadir, who has three goals in the tournament, scored the lone goal.

25577,2020-07-25 20:45,Red Stars set to face upstart Dash in NWSL's Challenge Cup final,"Even though its under dramatically different circumstances, the Chicago Red Stars are getting another chance at a National Women's Soccer League title.

Last season, the Red Stars got into the NWSL championship game but were routed 4-0 by the North Carolina Courage.

On Sunday, they'll play for the Challenge Cup championship against the Houston Dash. The monthlong tournament was the league's re-boot after the regular season was shut down by the coronavirus outbreak.

""I don't think a lot of us thought that we'd be back in a final after last year this quickly,"" Chicago forward Savannah McCaskill said. ""So it's kind of nice to get a second chance at it.""

The NWSL was the first professional team sport to return in the United States. Eight of the league's nine teams have been sequestered in Utah for the duration of the tournament, which started on June 27.

The league's ninth team, the Orlando Pride, withdrew shortly before the start because of positive COVID-19 tests. But there were no positive tests in the so-called bubble in Utah for the duration of the event.

NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird, who had been officially on the job for only about 48 hours when she had to call off the season, touted the league's comprehensive medical protocol for the tournament's success.

""Life in the bubble and competing in the bubble is intense, as many of you know, and I'm really proud of our players and the team staffs for the quality and the excitement of the play,"" she said in a state-of-the-league news conference before the final.

The Red Stars were the tournament's sixth seed going into the knockout round. They advanced to the semifinals on penalties after a scoreless draw with OL Reign, then held off Sky Blue 3-2 on Wednesday.

Chicago had just two total goals in the tournament before the outburst against Sky Blue.

'Building at the right time'

""We're building at the right time and I think our movements in the attacking third are starting to click, and we're starting to really learn each other,"" McCaskill said. ""It's hard to develop those relationships in a very short time. You usually have an eight-month season to build to this moment, to build to a final, but I think everyone's done a really good job and obviously scoring three goals last game is going to give us momentum going into tomorrow.""

The Dash are the upstart underdogs of the Challenge Cup, having never made the playoffs in seven years in the league.

Major improvement for Houston

Houston finished seventh in the NWSL last season, but has shown vast improvement over the course of the tournament under coach James Clarkson.

""James came into the preseason with a pretty strict blueprint about how we wanted to defend, and how our attack will start from that,"" Dash goalkeeper Jane Campbell said. ""In the tournament, the games we've played really well I think we've followed that blueprint pretty close to 100% as possible, and the games we haven't done so well, we've kind of shied away from that.""

Rachel Daly has three goals in the tournament, while teammate Shea Groom has two. Daly was named the Challenge Cup's most valuable player on Saturday.

Campbell has 17 saves, ranking just below Chicago's Alyssa Naeher, the U.S. national team goalkeeper, with 18.

""Yeah, we're writing this underdog story, but all along we've been telling ourselves that we can do this, "" Campbell said. ""We just have to believe in ourselves and go play out the blueprint.""

25489,2020-07-24 10:23,Secret to her success: NWSL commissioner guiding league through pandemic,"Just five months into her tenure, National Women's Soccer League commissioner Lisa Baird navigated a return to sport during a pandemic, negotiated a landmark broadcast deal, secured big-name sponsors and announced a flashy new expansion team in Los Angeles. Now just imagine what she can do for the league in a regular year.

Ahead of Sunday's NWSL Challenge Cup final between the Houston Dash and Chicago Red Stars in Sandy, Utah, Baird can almost take a deep sigh of relief (or maybe get some sleep). It's certainly much different than those dire days of March.

Baird officially took the commissioner's role on March 10. The sports world came to halt two days later.

""What was remarkable to me was how quickly the entire sports industry shut down worldwide,"" Baird told CBC Sports. ""Once [commissioner] Adam Silver had started it with the NBA, around the world it was literally that quick. I think the rest of the industries maybe weren't as quick as the sports industry to understand the sobering reality of what we were dealing with because of live sports, contact sports and fans.""

When you look at Baird's resume — executive and marketing leadership positions at the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committees, the NFL and IBM, to name a few — perhaps it's no surprise the NWSL's return has gone safely and smoothly (aside from Orlando's withdrawal due to positive COVID-19 tests before the tournament).

What's been the secret to her success? Just like soccer, a whole lot of teamwork and hustle.

During the early days of the shutdown, Baird reached out to her contacts in the sports world. She pulled knowledge from more well-resourced leagues, like MLS (she says league commissioner Don Garber was of particular help). She and her team set goals and principles.

Being a small, nimble league was also plus.

""I could pick up the phone and in a day contact any owner I needed,"" Baird said. ""I was able to do several Zoom calls with all athletes on the call, working through issues in real time as we were developing it.""

Virtual calls

Sitting on one of those first nerve-wracking virtual calls was veteran Canadian midfielder Diana Matheson of the Utah Royals.

""That was a tough situation because she was fielding questions on a tournament people were very unsure about,"" said Matheson, the two-time Olympic bronze medallist (you may remember her iconic winning goal from London 2012).

""I was very impressed that she held the call in the first place and also the way she conducted herself. She wasn't afraid to take our questions, give answers when she had them or tell people when she didn't have the answers and that she would go find them.""

After a one-month training camp, the teams arrived in Utah ready to play a month-long World Cup style tournament. The short turnaround didn't hurt the quality of play and viewers took notice. The opening game between North Carolina and Christine Sinclair's Portland Thorns drew an eye-popping record 572,000 total viewers on CBS, a +201 per cent increase from the previous best of 190,000 set back in 2014. CBS hasn't given its numbers for its All Access digital service, which broadcasts most games.

One of the main things that attracted Baird to take the NWSL's reigns in its eighth season was its values, all which coincidentally have helped the league endure these pandemic times.

""We're scrappy. We fight to the finish and I think you see that on the field with these players right now. These two teams that are going into the final are going to fight for the finish. We are scrappy, we have spirit and heart and we are not giving up,"" she said.

""We are humble, we are respectful. We, as a league. And I don't think it's just the fact that we're women. We have male owners and coaches, We're a very diverse league. We're always going to be that league that's appreciative of what we have.

""And the third thing is that we're ambitious and we are leaders. When it's a normal time, we would have 58 of the best players from around the world playing in our league. We want to own the mantle of being the best professional women's soccer in the world. We're grateful that we have some of the best and biggest names, but we have more ambition where that's concerned.""

Social issues

Also at its core, the NWSL and its players have always been at the forefront when it comes to social issues, whether it be pay equity or social justice. On June 27, the opening game of the tournament, on national television, they focused their awareness and support to Black Lives Matter. It's continued through the tournament.

""I think because we were the first league back there were a lot of people paying attention to what was going on,"" Baird said. ""It was a very intense time for the players, particularly because they're in a new environment, they're in the bubble, we were the first team out. I was so supportive of the freedom of expression, but I was so impressed by the courage of our players to do it. It's not an easy time to make a stand on social justice. I think what they did was really important. I know our fans were very supportive.""

After last week's dramatic quarter-finals, which saw the top three seeds ousted from the tournament, including the two-time defending champion North Carolina Courage, there was more intrigue this week with expansion news.

Los Angeles, with an ownership group featuring A-listers from Hollywood, sports, and the corporate world, will become the NWSL's 11th franchise in 2022 after Racing Louisville FC joins the fray next year.

""LA is a sports city. The fans have wanted this franchise for a long time,"" Baird said. ""I'm really excited to be working with them.""

Tentatively named Angel City FC, the Los Angeles ownership group includes former U.S. women's national team stars Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach and Julie Foudy; celebrities like founder Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, Jessica Chastain, America Fererra, Jennifer Garner and Uzo Aduba; and business leaders including Kara Nortman, Julie Uhrman and Alexis Ohanian (and don't forget the youngest owner, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., yes, the daughter of Serena Williams and Ohanian).

""Everybody's like 'what do you think of a two-year-old in the owner's room?' And I said, 'I don't know but I think we're the most family-friendly professional league that I've ever seen, so she's welcome,'"" joked Baird, adding ""I'll give a shoutout to my colleague Cathy Engelbert of the WNBA, but we're pretty family friendly here.""

With 14 Canadians playing in the league, is there any potential for expansion north of the border? She won't comment on that just yet, but said this:

""Canadian fans, if you're interested in having a team, reach out to us on social media, follow us, make sure that you're watching us. At the end of the day we're going to be driven for what's right for the sport and what's right for the players, but I pay attention to fans and if you guys are interested, keep that support coming and I'm taking calls.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/lisa-baird-nwsl-soccer-1.5661619?cmp=rss,sports,soccer,

The MLS champion Seattle Sounders could thank the Vancouver Whitecaps for keeping them out of the Group B basement prior to their meeting Sunday night.

""It's a little surprising because those are teams that have been very consistent over the last few years,"" said Toronto FC coach Greg Vanney. ""But having what has transpired over the last several months leading into an event like this, there's always teams — even in World Cups — that don't quite perform maybe as you had expected for one reason or another.

""Those are good teams and I think over a long season they would prove that they're good teams. This [tournament] is a very short season, in a way,"" he added.

Toronto, in contrast, has already found its feet. And while still a work in progress, it has shown resilience and a deft scoring touch despite missing star striker Jozy Altidore as he works his way back to full fitness.

The MLS Cup runner-up started well against D.C. United, only to cough up two late goals in a 2-2 tie. Then it dispatched Montreal 4-3.

WATCH | Akinola's magic helps TFC upend Impact:

Toronto FC homegrown player Ayo Akinola of Brampton, Ont., scored a hat trick as Toronto FC beat the Montreal Impact 4-3. Akinola has now scored five goals in two games. 1:56

Toronto takes on the New England Revolution on Tuesday morning with both teams knowing a win means finishing atop Group C. A draw opens the door to D.C. United, which could then climb into first with a victory over pointless Montreal later Tuesday.

With tournament group games counting in the regular-season standings, there is an added incentive to notch another win Tuesday.

The pluses for Toronto include 20-year-old striker Ayo Akinola, whose five goals were more than 20 of the 24 teams at the tournament had going into play Sunday.

Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo had a hand in all of Akinola's goals and is developing a promising rapport on the right side with Brazilian fullback Auro and Argentine newcomer Pablo Piatti.

Captain Michael Bradley, coming off ankle surgery, has looked rejuvenated at the heart of the Toronto midfield.

The minus is Toronto has conceded five goals in two games. Only the Los Angeles Galaxy, with eight, had conceded more prior to Sunday.

Vanney says his team got disconnected on defence late against D.C. United and Montreal.

""Our timing of when we're trying to move together as a group and control things defensively hasn't been great,"" he conceded.

'Group still needs to mould together'

He points to rust, from the lengthy pandemic-related hiatus prior to the tournament, and the oppressive conditions in Florida. That means the team isn't dealing with problems as a unit, with individuals having to step up to deal with situations -- with varying degrees of success.

""I think guys are naturally trying to find little moments where they can kind of catch their breath and deal with the heat and the humidity and the fatigue factor of our games coming quickly. Guys are resting at the wrong times … We're getting a little disconnected on the defensive side.""

Vanney said he is trying to maintain some continuity in his lineup ""because I think our group still needs to mould together here a little as this event continues, if we're going to have a chance to win it.""

Still Vanney likes the way his team has gritted it out through the tough times. ""And we've obviously had some very, very good moments with those games.

""But we're still working towards that collective 90-minute game that we've haven't hit yet. Not many teams have.""

The top team in Group C advances to the round of 16 against one of the four best third-place finishers next Sunday. The runner-up plays next Saturday against the second-place team in Group A, either Orlando City or the Philadelphia Union.

Vanney says midfielder Jonathan Osorio (quad) and Altidore are making progress but seemed to suggest minutes off the bench would be a best-case scenario Tuesday.

Why cities are planting more 'food forests'

The 7 layers of a food forest

Why cities are planting 'food forests'

(City of Red Deer)

Many of us see forests as places to walk, hike and enjoy nature. But more and more cities are planting ""food forests"" — not just for strolling through, but for growing fruits and veggies.

At the Cowichan Green Community Food Forest in Duncan, B.C., visitors can amble along green microclover pathways in the shade of big-leaf maple trees to pick herbs such as rosemary and savory, vegetables like asparagus, as well as fruits, including salmonberries, grapes, plums, kiwis and figs — for free.

""It's quite the jungle right now,"" said Janice MacKirdy, who runs the garden for the non-profit Cowichan Green Community Society, an environmental group focused on food security.

The roughly one-acre plot attracts families, who fill their baskets during berry season, and is a refuge and quiet thoroughfare for workers in the city centre. The community group also uses the harvest in its Meals on Wheels program for seniors and sells some at its ""reFRESH Store,"" which rescues surplus and potentially wasted perishable food.

Similar edible landscapes are popping up across the country, from Hay River, N.W.T ., to Sudbury, Ont .

Red Deer, Alta., has no fewer than eight community orchards and food forests, planted since 2011, where the public can harvest nuts such as hazelnuts and walnuts and fruit such as haskap berries, cherries, apples and plums.

""This is an amazing activity to get people interacting with nature,"" said Trevor Poth, parks superintendent for the City of Red Deer.

Both Poth and MacKirdy say urban food forests tend to be more appealing to people who might not normally go hiking or use community gardens, which require more work and personal commitment.

While Red Deer's primary goal is to create a sustainable source of local food, these forests have other benefits, too, such as attracting and supporting birds and pollinators.

The city tries to plant them in partnership with schools or community groups to maximize opportunities to educate the public about where their food comes from and what can be grown locally.

""You teach kids … what berries they can eat off what tree,"" Poth said. ""Those kids go home and they tell their parents, and then the parents plant cherry trees in their backyard and they plant haskap and they plant apple trees. So we're really trying to be the driver of change.""

He said that while many cities quietly put edible plants along roadways, Red Deer is ""quite pushy, in fact, about sharing our knowledge of what we can grow."" It provides detailed maps showing exact locations and varieties of edible plants.

Poth said access to this fresh, local food has had a positive impact on people's physical and mental health during the pandemic, which has forced many to look for outdoor activities close to home.

""People are happy or they feel more self-sustaining, and it's been an excellent thing this year. It's been one of the great positives, I think, that's come out of coronavirus.""

Reader feedback

Responding to Emily Chung's story last week on Plastic Free July , Diana Dunlop captured the dilemma of trying to avoid excess packaging during the pandemic.

""I haven't used any plastic bags for packing groceries in these past few months. I just put my purchased groceries back in the cart and pack them when I get to the car.… A lot of produce does not need to be bagged, e.g. bananas, potatoes, yams, lemons, etc. However, some organic produce comes bagged, and not sure how to get around that.

""[I] have had to resort to new plastic bags at the bulk food stores, but have those washed and ready to be reused as soon as it is allowable. I have not purchased any bags for at least six years, and reuse produce bags or ones I made myself from curtain netting.

""Horrified at the amount of recyclable material just being chucked at a coffee shop the other day, so I brought mine home so I could recycle and made a commitment to myself not to go there again.

""Am not good with dish soap and laundry soap containers — will have to revisit the fill store again, just found them very expensive. But your [newsletter] made me think that I could do more.""

The Big Picture: The 7 layers of a food forest

In order to maximize the amount of food that can be grown in a certain area, food forests are often designed to mimic a natural forest, with similar ""layers"" of plants that serve different roles in the ecosystem.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

The brand Tupperware is synonymous with reusable containers for food storage. The U.S. company has announced a new initiative called No Time to Waste , in which it is committing to greater sustainability through a number of measures, including creating new materials using mixed plastic waste and reducing its energy and water usage .

After tense negotiations — including some theatrical fits of anger from leaders like France's Emmanuel Macron — the countries of the EU have agreed on a financial recovery plan for the pandemic. And it includes the largest green stimulus plan in history , worth more than 500 billion euros (or almost $750 billion Cdn).

This week, Swedish climate crusader Greta Thunberg won the inaugural Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity , which recognizes environmental activism. The award is worth $1.14 million US, and Thunberg has announced that $114,000 of that will go to SOS Amazônia, an organization dedicated to protecting the rainforest, and another $114,000 will go to the Stop Ecocide Foundation, which is working to make environmental destruction an international crime.

These Quebecers are fighting for the right to grow a wild garden

(Stu Mills/CBC)

A western Quebec couple is in a battle with their municipality over a specially designed yard containing milkweed, tall grasses and wildflowers.

Last summer, the municipality of La Pêche informed Jazmine Maisonneuve and Samuel Cloutier, both 37, that the tall-growing vegetation on the commercial property surrounding a new workshop facility in the village of Masham constituted a ""nuisance.""

La Pêche's bylaw requires that lawns be kept no higher than 15 centimetres. Last month, the municipality sent the couple another warning and told them they faced a $400 fine if they didn't mow it.

""We very deliberately and intentionally did not sow grass. We don't want to mow our lawn. We don't want a lawn, in fact — we want a meadow,"" said Maisionneuve, a landscape designer.

The municipality told the couple that a neighbour complained the yard — which is filled with milkweed, thistles, Queen Anne's lace and other flowers that attract pollinators — lowered neighbouring property values. Maisonneuve rejects that assertion.

""We feel this is much more beautiful than our neighbours' scorched, mowed, brown lawn right now,"" she said.

Cloutier, a custom home builder and metal fabricator, said he got a call from a municipal employee who told him the municipality would take the couple to court over the tall plants. He also said the municipality told the couple they'd be able to keep the yard if they hired a biologist to catalogue the different wildflowers growing on the property.

But when they paid a biologist $400 and sent photos and descriptions to the municipality, it rejected the report, Cloutier said, as it didn't include a site plan with the locations of the flowers.

Cloutier said he told the municipality he wouldn't spend any more money on flower reports and welcomes an opportunity to fight it out legally.

""It's pretty surprising that in 2020 we're having this discussion,"" Cloutier said. ""I think any judge in court would use their common sense and say, 'Hey, we're wasting our time here.'""

The dispute comes as the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has a campaign urging utility providers and municipalities not to spray pesticides and to permit public lands, power corridors and rights-of-way to grow over with pollinator-friendly flowers and vegetation.

CWF researcher Carolyn Callaghan said the campaign is also targeting the roughly 6.2 million private residential lawns in Canada.

""Many of us have a long-standing love affair with [a] cut, mown lawn. We think it's neat and tidy and beautiful,"" said Callaghan. ""Unfortunately, it's a desert — it does not support many species, and it certainly doesn't support pollinators because there are no flowers.""

In an email to CBC News, La Pêche Mayor Guillaume Lamoureux said the bylaw was ""obsolete and unenforceable."" He said he wasn't aware of a case where a property owner had been fined under the bylaw, and he would like to see it removed in a future review.

Lamoureux also said he couldn't be sure if the municipality would make good on its threat to take Cloutier and Maisonneuve to court.

25445,2020-07-24 4:00,"Strong efforts to reduce plastic could still leave 710 million tons in the environment by 2040, study suggests","Plastic pollution is ubiquitous, seemingly found in every nook and cranny around the world, from some of the deepest parts of the oceans, to the Arctic, to drinking water.

But a new paper published in the journal Science on Thursday suggests that, with global efforts, we can drastically reduce the amount of plastic waste found on land and in our oceans, though eliminating it entirely isn't likely.

""It's a big, complicated, messy problem that spans the entire world and across many different economies, and many different countries, and different industries,"" said Richard Bailey, professor of environmental systems at Oxford University and co-author of the paper. ""So there isn't really a single solution; that we can show now definitively for the first time.""

The authors looked at different pathways ranging from business-as-usual, where no effort is made to reduce plastic pollution, to the best-case scenario, where multiple efforts are implemented, both upstream (at the production level) and downstream, like recycling and waste management.

With business-as-usual, 29 million tons of plastic would be produced annually up until 2040. In the best-case scenario, that falls to 5 million tons. Put another way, it's the difference between a total of 761 million tons by 2040 or 1.8 billion tons.

(SYSTEMIQ)

While the idea of plastic pollution totalling 761 million tons still piling up across our planet might seem like anything but good news, the researchers say this just illustrates how much worse it could be without a global effort.

""The good news is, if you do something, it makes a difference,"" said lead author Winnie Lau, a senior manager at Pew Charitable Trust, an independent U.S.-based non-governmental organization. ""People need to know that if I do something, I'll make a difference. And we want to highlight that, but we also want to highlight there's a real urgency here, and we really have to get a move on it.""

Challenges

The encouraging news, the authors say, is that technology is already available to make the reductions.

But what that looks like varies from country to country.

For example, in high-income countries, better recycling programs could help mitigate how much plastic ends up in landfills. But one of the biggest challenges relates to the different types of plastic being used.

""I think actually that the main problem is design,"" said Jutta Gutberlet, a professor at the University of Victoria's department of geography and co-author of the paper. ""Many of them are not recyclable plastic … because nowadays we have so many different qualities of plastic in circulation, that they cannot be recycled. Twenty years ago we had maybe 10 types of plastic, but now we have almost infinite types of plastic.""

Some types of plastic are virtually impossible to recycle, she said.

Then there are low- and middle-income countries, where recycling programs may not be robust enough.

Gutberlet said that their study emphasizes the need to integrate the valuable work of waste-pickers in those nations. Currently, she said, the fact that many operate outside of formal regulatory regimes without protections means they are exploited and tend to work in unhealthy conditions. However, by bringing them into the formal labour force, they can help make an impact on a problem that is largely caused by high-income countries, she said.

""In our report, we see an opportunity to improve the livelihoods of these people by valuing the service they're already doing.""

Watch | Breaking the plastic wave, from Pew Charitable Trust:

Jennifer Provencher, an adjunct professor at Carleton University in Ottawa and head of the Wildlife Health Unit at the Canadian Wildlife Service who was not involved in the paper, said she's pleased to see the study.

""This is an interesting way, I think, to start looking at how do we reduce the effects on ecosystems? How do we reduce the effects of wildlife? How do we reduce the effects on species that frankly are food?"" she said of plastic waste in the environment. ""And the answer in this paper is we have to do everything right, we have to do a system change scenario. There's no silver bullet.""

And she said that the focus shouldn't be what happens after the plastic is manufactured; rather the aim should be reducing overall plastic production.

""We need to turn the tap off. We should not focus on cleanup efforts, because if your basement is flooding, you don't run for the bucket; you run to the tap and you turn the tap off,"" Provencher said.

Provencher does have one concern about the study.

""This is a very interesting paper, but it is very much from that developed country perspective,"" she said. ""There are challenges that developing countries are going to have. And they do touch upon this very briefly but not specifically in terms of how do you move global households to a new system.""

Both Lau and Gutberlet acknowledge that plastic does have a valuable role in our lives, citing its use in the medical industry. But the key is making better plastic, and having systems in place to reuse and recycle it.

The main emphasis of this study, the authors say, is to help governments and industry understand that a combined effort is needed. But it also means that, individually, we should also be mindful about our own plastic consumption.

And just because we can't eliminate all plastic doesn't mean reducing consumption is a pointless endeavour.

""I'm sure we've all heard [the phrase] before, which is not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,"" said Bailey. ""And I think it's a case of that, just because we can't solve the problem doesn't mean we shouldn't (try).""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/plastic-reduction-1.5659383?cmp=rss,news,technology,
